<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">In</span> days gone by, the painter who served the usual term of apprenticeship
was deemed to have done all that was required to qualify him for his
trade. He may have learned little or much, but he had “served his time,”
and that was all that was expected of him. So far as it went, the
training was good, because it was nothing if not practical, and practice
is an essential element of skill. But nowadays such a training can only
be considered partial; mere practice, without any scientific knowledge
of the principles which underlie it, is but half a qualification for the
workman who aims at being really a master of his trade.</p>

<p>When competition was unknown, and the low prices of raw material offered
no inducement for passing off inferior or fraudulent substitutes, there
was less need for a high degree of knowledge. But under modern
conditions, the painter who is unable to gauge the qualities of the
materials he uses, and who is ignorant of the rules which govern those
qualities, and of the principles which determine the use of this and the
rejection of that article, cannot long survive in the struggle for
supremacy or even livelihood.</p>

<p>Hence the need for a handbook such as this volume aims at being. Granted
that our technical schools and colleges are affording a liberal and
invaluable education to the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>man who will avail himself of the
opportunities given him, still a man does not remain for ever at school,
and he needs a guide-book, handy of reference and accessible in price,
to refresh his memory and supplement the information gained in the
class-room and workshop.</p>

<p>To fulfil this useful purpose is the aim and object of this unpretending
volume.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<b>PRELIMINARY.</b></h2>

<p><b>Colour.</b>&mdash;The term “colour” is inappropriately given by
common usage to material substances which convey a sense
of colour to the human eye, but is properly restricted to
that sense itself. The material colour should be called
“pigment” or “dyestuff” in the raw state, and paint when
compounded with other substances for application in the
form of a coating.</p>

<p>The sense of colour is due to light. In the absence
of light there is no colour, only blackness; and black is
really no colour, but an absence of colour. Very many
conditions combine to cause different colour sensations, some
of which are understood, while others we are not able to
explain.</p>

<p>For instance, take the action of heat upon a solution of
chloride of cobalt. As soon as the liquid becomes warm, the
pink colour disappears and gives place to blue; but on
pouring water into it, the blue vanishes and the pink reappears.
Again, on heating the blue crystals of sulphate of
copper they become white, but the blue colour comes back
when water is added, and the solution assumes a deeper tint
as it dissolves more of the white powder.</p>

<p>If all the rays are cut off from an electric light except
those which are in and beyond the violet, and a flask con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>taining
a solution of sulphate of quinine is held in that
portion of the spectrum, it will become luminous. The
same thing will occur even more strikingly on placing a
piece of uranium glass in the ultra-violet rays. The explanation
of this phenomenon is that beyond those rays
which give light there are others which do not give light,
i. e. which do not cause us to experience the sensation of
light; the reason being that their vibrations are too rapid.
But when certain other substances, such as sulphate of
quinine, or a thin slip of uranium glass, are placed in the
path of the rays, this rapid motion is arrested and modified,
and these rays, which in themselves are not luminous, are
reflected back to our eyes as luminous rays. The rapidity
of the vibrations being moderated, our retinas become
sensible to them as rays of blue light.</p>

<p>Colour does not depend only upon chemical composition
nor solely upon the aggregation of the particles, but upon
these and other things besides not yet explained. All
matter is in a state of motion. If you heat a substance you
communicate an increased activity of motion to the particles
of which it consists. When certain coloured rays of light
are falling upon a substance, these coloured rays of light
have a motion peculiar to themselves. It may be that the
degree of motion in that substance, either existing in it
naturally without heating, or communicated to it by
artificial heating, is such that these rays of light are precisely
those which that substance is not capable of sending back to
our eyes. They are then absorbed or destroyed in some
way, by the particular state of that substance upon which
they fall; and those rays which the substance is capable of
reflecting back are mainly sent back to our eyes. Certain
colours, such as blue, yellow, and green, absorb certain rays
more or less perfectly, and reflect back in the main blue,
yellow, and green to our eyes. Hence it is incumbent on
those who are studying colour, and who are interested in
the purity and permanency of colour, to comprehend at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the principles of that science of light which tells of the
action of light upon various bodies that are used as pigments
in painting.</p>

<p>If we put together two substances one of which destroys
or modifies the chemical condition or state of the other, then
certainly one of those substances, and very probably both,
will lose the colour which it had before it came into contact
with the other. It is therefore most important that all
engaged in the preparation and use of colours should make
a study of this science of light. Of almost equal value is a
study of the science of heat. We have seen what heat can
do in changing the conditions of a substance. To give
another instance. The black sulphide of mercury, after
sublimation by heat, exhibits properties, imparted to it by
the heat, which it did not possess before, i. e. it can, by
trituration, be brought to display a red colour.</p>

<p>On showing the spectrum on a screen, if some solution of
soda or other sodium salt be held in the course of the light,
almost all the coloured rays but one will be cut off, and a
little band is seen in the yellow part of the spectrum. This
is because the sodium flame is almost “monochromatic,” or
single-lined: it cuts off all the colours but the yellow.
Again, if metallic thallium is held in the flame, the only
band remaining in the spectrum will be the green; and if a
lithium salt, the only surviving colour will be red.</p>

<p><b>Pigments.</b>&mdash;The term “pigments” is applied to those
colouring matters which are mixed in a powdery form with
oil or other vehicle for the purpose of painting. They
differ in this respect from the dyestuffs, which are always
employed in solution. A very large proportion of the pigments
in common use are derived from the mineral kingdom,
the most notable exceptions being found in the blacks and
lakes. All pigments are required to possess “body,” or
density and opacity; to be insoluble in water and most
other solvents, except the stronger mineral acids; and to be
inert, or incapable of exercising chemical or other influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
on each other or on the vehicle or drier with which they are
mixed prior to use. They may be conveniently classified
according to their colours in the first place, reserving the
consideration of their preparation for use for a later chapter.
The chief classes are Blacks, Blues, Browns, Greens, Reds,
Whites, and Yellows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<b>BLACKS.</b></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">All</span> the black pigments in use owe their colour to carbon,
and all are produced by artificial means, no natural form of
carbon possessing the requisite qualities.</p>

<p>Several manufactured carbonaceous substances are known
in commerce under the generic name of “Blacks.” The
most important of these are animal-black, bone-black, Frankfort-black,
ivory-black, and lamp-black. They are usually
obtained by carbonising organic matter, particularly bones, in
closed vessels or crucibles, or by collecting the soot formed by
the combustion of oily, resinous, and bituminous substances.
Other blacks than those enumerated are manufactured, but
only on so small a scale as to be of no commercial
importance.</p>

<p>Carbon, lamp, and vegetable blacks consist almost entirely
of carbon, containing usually from 98 to 99½ per cent. of
that substance, the residue consisting of a little ash, water,
and occasionally unburnt oil. Bone and ivory blacks, on the
other hand, are chiefly composed of mineral matter, which
may amount to 65 or 75 per cent. and is mainly represented
by phosphate of lime. Their actual colouring matter, the
carbon, only constitutes 15 to 30 per cent. of the mass. The
balance is water and unburnt animal tissue. Blacks prepared
from animal matters other than bone and ivory carry 40 to
80 per cent. of carbon, and their mineral matter is generally
in the form of carbonates of lime and of the alkalies.</p>

<p>The principal impurity to be watchful of in the vegetable
and lamp blacks is a small quantity of oily matter which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
may seriously interfere with their drying qualities. They
should leave very little ash after being burned in a crucible.
Bone and ivory blacks are sometimes valued as much for
their mineral matter as for their colouring matter. The proportion
of this mineral matter is ascertained by heating a
certain weight of the black to red heat in a crucible till
every trace of black has disappeared, and then weighing the
residue. The residue should next be boiled in strong hydrochloric
acid till it is dissolved; if there is any which will
not dissolve it is most probably barytes, which has been
added as an adulterant and to make the black weigh heavy.
When the solution is complete, the addition of ammonia will
throw down a precipitate of phosphate of lime, which should
equal 60 to 70 per cent. of the original weight of mineral
matter. If much less than this, it is likely that whiting or
gypsum has been mixed with the pigment. As carbon is not
acted upon by acids or alkalies, it follows that all pure
carbon blacks are in themselves perfectly stable and permanent
pigments, and that they exert no influence on other
pigments with which they may be mixed.</p>

<p><b>Animal-black.</b>&mdash;This substance is almost identical with
bone-black, but is generally in a more finely divided state.
Any animal refuse matter may be used in its preparation,
such as albumen, gelatine, horn shavings, &amp;c. These are
subjected to dry distillation in an earthenware retort. An
inflammable gas is given off, together with much oily matter,
ammonia, and water, while a black carbonaceous mass is left
behind. This is washed with water and powdered in a mill,
the product being animal-black. It is largely used in the
manufacture of paint, printing ink, and blacking.</p>

<p><b>Bone-black.</b>&mdash;When bones are heated in a retort or
crucible, the organic constituents are decomposed and
carbonised. A mixture of combustible gases is given off;
some of these do not condense on cooling, others condense in
the form of a heavy oil, called bone-oil. Also much water containing
tarry water and ammoniacal salts in solution passes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
over. The residue in the retort or crucible consists of finely
divided carbon, in intimate mixture with the inorganic constituents
of the bones: this mixture constitutes ordinary
bone-black, or animal charcoal, as it is sometimes called.
The inorganic portion may, if required, be removed by
washing the residue in dilute hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>The process, as worked on the large scale, is carried on in
different ways, according as it is desired to collect the
volatile condensable portion of the distillate, or to allow it
to escape. In the latter case, when it is required to obtain
only bone-black, the apparatus employed is of a very simple
nature, and the amount of fuel needed is comparatively
small. The carbonisation is effected in fire-clay crucibles,
16 in. high and 12 in. diameter. These are to be preferred to
crucibles made of iron, which were much used at one time,
since they do not lose their round form when subjected to a
high temperature; in consequence of this, they fit more
closely together in the furnace, less air can penetrate, and
therefore less of the charcoal is consumed by oxidation. The
furnace is an ordinary flat hearth, having a superficial area of
about 40 square yards, and is covered in with a flat arch, all
of brickwork. The fireplace is situate in the middle of the
hearth; the crucibles are introduced through doors in the
front, which are bricked up when the furnace is filled; each
furnace holds eighteen crucibles. The crucibles, filled with
the coarsely broken bones, are covered with a lid luted on
with clay. To economise fuel, the furnaces should be in a
row, and placed back to back.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the furnace and pots is shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_1">1</a>
and <a href="#fig_2">2</a>. A is the fireplace; B, the crucibles, eighteen in number,
spread over the floor of the furnace in a single layer; <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>,
and <i>f</i> are the flues for conducting away the heated gases
arising from the calcination of the bones, as well as the
waste heat itself; the last portion of the flue is fitted with a
damper <i>g</i>. The furnaces are intended to be built in fours,
back to back, the waste heat serving in a great measure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
conduct the operation of the revivifying apparatus placed in
the centre of the group, and marked C.</p>

</div>

<p>When the furnace is filled and the doors are bricked up, the
heat is slowly raised to redness, at which point it is kept for
six or eight hours. The combustible gases are evolved and
consumed in the furnace as the bones begin to decompose,
and by this means so much heat is produced that only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
small quantity of fuel is needed to maintain the required
temperature. When the carbonisation is complete, the doors
are taken down and the crucibles are removed to cool, their
places being immediately filled with fresh ones. The heat
must be kept as uniform as possible throughout the process:
if it be not sufficiently high, the bone-black will contain a
portion of undecomposed organic matter, which renders it
quite unfit for use; if, on the other hand, the temperature
be raised too high, the bone-black will become dense and
compact, whereby its efficacy as a decoloriser is much reduced.
When the charcoal in the crucible has become perfectly cool,
it is removed and crushed. When required for decolorising
or deodorising purposes, it is only roughly broken up into
small lumps, in which form it is most readily applicable.
The crushing is effected by means of two grooved cylinders,
consisting of toothed discs, alternately 10 and 12 in. in
diameter. These are so placed that the 10-in. discs of one
cylinder are opposite the 12-in. discs of the other, and thus,
in revolving, the carbonised bones are crushed to fragments
between them, but are not reduced to powder. They are
passed successively through six of these mills, the cylinders
of each couple being nearer to each other than the last.
Finally the crushed bones are carefully sieved; the powder
is placed apart from the lumps, again passed through finer
sieves, and sorted out into different sizes.</p>

<p>A furnace such as that described above will carbonise four
charges of bones in one day, each charge being more than
half a ton in weight. With careful work, the bones will
yield 60 per cent. of bone-black, or more than one ton
daily.</p>

<p>If it be required to condense the volatile gaseous products
of the carbonisation, this process is conducted in retorts
similar to those used in the manufacture of acetic acid from
wood: these are so arranged that the whole of the gaseous
products are condensed and collected. The aqueous portion
of the distillate is usually evaporated down to obtain salts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
ammonia; the uncondensable gases may be employed for
illuminating purposes. The manufacture of bone-black is
usually carried on in the neighbourhood of large towns,
where a good supply of bones may be readily obtained.</p>

<p>Ordinary bone-black has about the following composition:
Phosphate and carbonate of lime, and sulphide or oxide of
iron, 88 parts; charcoal, containing a small quantity of
nitrogenous matter, 10 parts; silicated carbide of iron,
2 parts. The decolorising properties of bone-black are due
solely to the presence of the charcoal.</p>

<p>When intended for use as a deodoriser or decoloriser, bone-black
should be kept carefully excluded from the air, for by
exposure it loses this power to a great extent, and becomes
almost inert. That which has been freshly burned is therefore
best for these purposes.</p>

<p>Bone-black never has the depth or brilliancy of lamp-black, but it mixes
well with either water or oil, and though a slow drier as an oil paint,
is permanent and not high priced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Frankfort-black or Drop-black.</b>&mdash;This is a black powder obtained from
dried vine-twigs carbonised to a full black and then ground very fine.
On a large scale it is prepared from a mixture of vine-twigs, wine-lees,
peach-stones, bone-shavings, and ivory refuse. It varies in shade
according as the animal or vegetable charcoal is in excess; when the
latter predominates, the powder is of a bluish colour; but when there is
an excess of animal charcoal, it has a brownish tinge. It is customary
to wash the powder well when first made, in order to remove any soluble
inorganic impurities. The finest Frankfort-black is probably the soot
obtained from the combustion of the materials mentioned above. It makes
an excellent pigment, and is extensively used by copperplate engravers
in the preparation of their ink. Drop-black is simply Frankfort-black
ground exceedingly fine, mixed with a little glue water, and dried in
pear-shaped drops for sale.</p>

<p><b>Ivory-black.</b>&mdash;Ivory-black is a beautiful black pigment prepared by
carbonising waste fragments and turnings of ivory. These are exposed to
a red heat for some hours in crucibles, great care being taken to avoid
overheating or burning. When quite cold, the crucibles are opened, and
the contents are pulverised, the richest coloured fragments being kept
apart for the best quality. The powder is then levigated on a porphyry
slab, washed well with hot water on a filter, and dried in an oven at a
temperature not exceeding 212° F. The product is of a very beautiful
velvety black colour, superior even to that obtained from peach-kernels,
and quite free from the reddish tinge which so often characterises
bone-black. Ivory-black, like Frankfort-black, is employed by
copperplate printers in the preparation of their ink. Mixed with white
lead, it affords a rich pearl-grey pigment.</p>

<p><b>Lamp-black.</b>&mdash;Lamp-black is an exceedingly light, dull-black powder,
formed by the imperfect combustion of oils, fats, resins, &amp;c. It may be
prepared on a small scale by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> suspending a small tin-plate funnel over
the flame of a lamp fed with oil, tallow, or crude naphtha, the wick
being so arranged that it shall burn with a large and smoky flame. Dense
masses of this light carbonaceous matter gradually collect in the
funnel, and may be removed from time to time. The funnel should be
furnished with a metal tube to convey the gases away from the room, but
no solder must be used in making the connections.</p>

<p>An especially fine quality of lamp-black is obtained from bone-oil,
deprived of the ammonia with which it is always contaminated. It is
manufactured on a commercial scale by means of the apparatus shown in
Figs. <a href="#fig_3">3</a> and <a href="#fig_4">4</a>. The oil is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> contained in the lamp A and kept at a
constant level by means of the globular vessel B, which is also filled
with oil and inverted over A. The oil flows from the lamp into the tube
C, which is bent upwards at the farther extremity on a level with the
oil in the lamp. A cotton wick is supplied to the bent end of the tube,
as well as a little spout D, for conducting away any oil that may
overflow into the receptacle E placed beneath. A conical hood <i>a</i>
surrounds the flame of the lamp and terminates in a tube <i>b</i>, through
which are conveyed the sooty products of the combustion of the oil into
the wide lateral tube <i>c</i>, arranged to accommodate the smoke from about
a dozen such lamps placed at intervals of about 6 feet, as indicated in
the figures. The effect of this wide tube <i>c</i> is not only to cool the
smoke, but also to collect the water and other liquids condensed. The
smoke and vapours pass hence into <i>d</i>, the first of a series of sacks
made of closely woven linen, about 10 or 12 feet long and 3 feet in
diameter, closed at the bottom with a trap or slide <i>e</i>, and formed at
the upper and lower ends of sheet-copper tubing made funnel-shaped. The
upper one of these is prolonged into an additional pipe <i>f</i>, by means of
which the smoke arrives at the second sack <i>g</i> in the series, thence
finding its way to the third, and so on till the last sack of the row is
reached. In connection with the last sack of each row is placed a
horizontal flue F, in which are arranged frames covered with wire gauze
and mounted on hinges. Their purpose is to retain the small remaining
portions of lamp-black passing out with the smoke from the sacks. The
meshes of the gauze are constantly getting filled up with soot, which
necessitates a periodical checking of the draught for its removal. This
is done by means of the rod G, which, when raised and allowed to fall
suddenly, jerks the accumulated mass off the gauze. The current of air
passing through the entire apparatus can be regulated by a damper placed
at the entrance to the chimney in which the flue F embouches. At regular
intervals, the mouthpieces in the lower ends of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> sacks are removed,
and their contents are shaken out separately and collected according to
their various qualities. That gathered from the first sack in each row
should always be kept apart from the remainder, as it is much
contaminated by the presence of resinous and tarry matters.</p>

</div>

<p>The old-fashioned method of preparing lamp-black from the incomplete
combustion of gas tar is conducted in an apparatus resembling that shown
in <a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a>. The furnace <i>a</i>, lined with fire-brick, contains a kettle
<i>b</i>, and is surmounted by a large thick cast-iron hood <i>c</i>,
communicating with a stone or brick condensing chamber, divided by means
of perforated partition walls into three unequal sized compartments <i>d</i>,
<i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, wherein the black is deposited. A chimney <i>g</i> delivers
uncondensed vapours into the atmosphere. In working, the furnace is
first brought to a red heat, then the kettle <i>b</i>, charged with tar, is
introduced. As a charge is finished, more tar is added, with occasional
stirring, till the kettle becomes inconveniently full of residue, when
it is withdrawn and a fresh one replaces it. The residue is chipped out
and used as fuel. The black is removed weekly through the door <i>h</i>. It
is of good quality and colour so long as the combustion is conducted
with a minimum of air, admission of which is controlled at the furnace.
The yield is about 25 per cent. of the weight of the tar; and one
furnace should treat a ton of tar in a week. One workman can manage
several furnaces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>An improved process has been introduced by Martin and Grafton for the
preparation of lamp-black from coal-tar, which affords a very good
product. The coal-tar is first stirred up energetically with lime-water
in any convenient vessel, after which the mixture is allowed to stand
until the coal-tar has subsided to the bottom, when the lime-water is
drawn off. The tar is then well washed by decantation with hot water,
and rectified in the ordinary naphtha still. Afterwards it is run into a
long iron cylinder, which is placed over a furnace, and supplied with
numerous large burners. Each burner has a metal funnel placed
immediately above it, connected with a cast-iron pipe, into which all
the fumes from each burner are conducted. The naphtha in the cylinder is
heated almost to the boiling point by the furnace beneath. A series of
smaller pipes lead away the fumes from the main pipe into a row of
chambers, and thence into a series of large canvas bags, placed side by
side, and connected alternately at top and bottom. The bags vary in
number from fifty to eighty, the last one being left open to allow the
smoke to escape, after traversing some 400 yards since leaving the
burners. The best quality of lamp-black is found in the last bags, that
near the furnace being much coarser and less pure. The bags are emptied
whenever they contain a sufficient quantity.</p>

<p>The process employed in Germany for the manufacture of lamp-black is to
conduct the products of the combustion of any resinous matter in a
furnace into a long flue, at the end of which is placed a loose hood,
made of some woollen material, and suspended by a rope and pulley. The
lamp-black collects in this hood, and, when a sufficient quantity has
accumulated, is shaken down and removed. In this manner about 6 cwt. of
lamp-black may be collected in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>One form of the apparatus is shown in <a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>. The circular structure <i>a</i>
is lined inside with hanging cloths upon which the black can condense,
and is covered with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> conical roof from which depends a movable
sheet-iron cone <i>b</i>, perforated at its apex to give egress to a current
of air. This cone <i>b</i> is supported by a rope <i>g</i> passing over a pulley
<i>c</i> and accessible from the outside. A fireplace <i>d</i>, containing a small
iron dish <i>e</i> for holding the resin, is built against one of the side
walls of the structure in such a manner that it can be fired externally.
The rate of combustion is regulated by a small sliding damper on the
door of the fireplace. When the black has accumulated in the chamber <i>a</i>
to such an extent that operations must be suspended, the fire is let
out, and the chamber is left to cool entirely, so that the black may not
ignite on contact with the air. The cone <i>b</i> is then lowered, and in its
descent scrapes the walls of the chamber <i>a</i> and causes the black to
collect on the floor, whence it is removed through an iron door <i>f</i>
which at other times is kept tightly luted.</p>

<p>In England, an inferior variety is sometimes obtained from the flues of
coke-ovens. That known as <i>Russian lamp-black</i> is made by burning chips
of resinous deal or pine wood, and collecting the soot formed; but it is
objectionable, owing to its liability to take fire spontaneously when
left for a long time moistened with oil.</p>

<p>A modified form of apparatus has been introduced by Thalwitzer, a German
manufacturer, and is shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_7">7</a> and <a href="#fig_8">8</a>. A vertical tube is provided
at its upper end with a funnel, into which cooling water is poured and
flows out through openings in the tube immediately above a circular
plate of thin cast or wrought iron arranged horizontally and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p class="nind">secured at its centre to the tube. Round the periphery of this plate is
a vertical rim of tin plate, at the top of which is a pipe through which
the cooling water runs into a gutter round the top of the cylindrical
casing, the water being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> carried off from this gutter by a pipe. The
vertical tube is carried near its upper end in a bearing, and at that
part is attached a worm-wheel geared into it by a worm driven by any
suitable power. At the underside of the circular plate is fixed a
scraper, the edge of which is formed with a strip of leather in contact
with the lower surface of the plate. Opposite the scraper, at the bottom
of the casing, is a burning lamp, which sucks up the oil for its
consumption by a flat wide wick.</p>

<p>The operation is as follows:&mdash;The vertical tube is caused to revolve by
the action of the worm-wheel, the circular plate thereby receiving a
slow rotary movement; and a small stream of water being poured into the
funnel at the top of the tube, this water passes down the latter and
through the openings on to the circular plate, which is thus kept cool.
The burning lamp filled with paraffin or other oil is brought as near to
the circular plate as is necessary for the cooling of the flame and the
most perfect extraction of the carbon, which, in the form of soot,
attaches itself readily to the plate, owing to its coldness and to the
condensation of the steam produced. The revolving plate presents
continually to the flames a new and clean surface, in consequence of the
lamp-black being scraped away by the scraper as soon as deposited, and
brought away through a pipe or shoot into a collecting barrel.</p>

<p>The apparatus as shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_7">7</a> and <a href="#fig_8">8</a> consists of a round metal plate
A, provided with a flange <i>a</i>, and fixed on a vertical shaft <i>b</i>
supported by the bearing B, and carrying at its upper end a worm wheel
<i>d</i> set in motion by a worm. The plate A is cooled by water admitted
through a pipe <i>g</i>, and the flange <i>a</i> is provided with a discharge pipe
<i>h</i>, through which the cooling water runs into the groove D, surrounding
the whole apparatus. Underneath the plate A a number of lamps J are
applied, which are fed with oil by a common pipe <i>l</i>. H is an oblique
scratcher or blade, the working edge of which is formed by a strip of
leather, and touches the lower surface of the plate A.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>For manufacturing lamp-black, a slow rotary motion is imparted to the
apparatus by means of the worm and worm-wheel, and a slight current of
water is directed upon the plate A through the pipe <i>g</i>. The lamps J,
filled with paraffin oil derived from lignite, or with any other
suitable oil, are ignited and approached to the plate A as far as is
necessary for cooling the flame, so as to deposit the greatest possible
quantity of black. The latter adheres to the cold surface of the plate,
which is also kept damp by the aqueous vapour formed during the
combustion. The revolution of the plate serves to bring the flame
continually into contact with new and clean portions of the plate, the
black being continually scraped off by the blade or scraper placed
opposite the flames, and conducted through a channel into a collecting
trough.</p>

<p>There is a risk of overburning, causing a grey tint and a hard and
granular texture.</p>

<p>A variety of lamp-black known as “carbon black” or “gas black,” has of
late years assumed an important position among black pigments. It is
produced in considerable quantities in the United States by the
combustion of the natural gas issuing from the earth in the mineral oil
regions. The soot arising from the imperfect combustion of the gaseous
hydrocarbon is made to deposit itself on cooled iron surfaces. These at
first were made stationary, but now take the form of revolving discs or
cylinders, which are automatically cleansed of the black as fast as it
is deposited. This type of lamp-black is remarkably free from mineral
impurities and unburned oil, and of a full colour.</p>

<p>An improved lamp-black kiln has been introduced in which the use of
water is dispensed with. It is shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_9">9</a> and <a href="#fig_10">10</a>. The furnace A,
which is preferably built double, as shown, is constructed of brick
lined with firebrick, with a rear wall <i>a</i> that divides the furnace room
from the condensing room, side walls <i>b</i>, front <i>c</i>, and central
dividing wall <i>d</i>, that divides the furnace into two long and narrow
fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">spaces. The bottom of the fire spaces <i>e</i> is formed by a sheet iron
plate <i>f</i> that is supported by the walls, and the space below plate <i>f</i>
serves as an air space through which air circulates by openings <i>g</i> in
the front and side walls, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> circulation of air tending to keep the
plate <i>f</i> cool. The rear of the fire space <i>e</i> extends upward and
communicates by an opening <i>h</i> through the wall with the condensing
room. In the front wall <i>c</i> is an opening to each fire space <i>e</i> and a
door <i>i</i> to each opening. The oil or other liquid is supplied by pipes
<i>k</i> that enter from the outside near the rear of the fire spaces. The
outer end of each pipe <i>k</i> is fitted with a cup-shaped receptacle <i>l</i>,
into which the oil will run from the vertical branch of the main supply
pipe <i>m</i>, so that the amount of oil running into each pipe <i>k</i> may be
observed, and regulated by a cock. The pipe <i>m</i> feeds the oil to one or
more furnaces, the supply of material to each furnace being separately
regulated. In the fire spaces beneath pipes <i>k</i> are placed shallow cast
iron drip pans <i>o</i> to receive the oil, and the oil running in faster
than it will burn will drop while on fire into the pans <i>o</i>, and be
spattered into small particles. These pans are changed frequently,
access to them being obtained by doors <i>i</i>. A slide <i>p</i> is provided in
each door <i>i</i> to allow of ventilation when required. The slides and
doors should close air-tight. By constructing the fire space <i>e</i> long
and narrow, the plate <i>f</i> is more readily kept cool, and the space in
front of the point of combustion renders the smoke less liable to escape
by the doors. The products of combustion pass through the opening <i>h</i> to
the condensing room, which is lathed and plastered, and if the room is
sufficiently large a number of furnaces may be fitted to discharge into
the same room. This furnace is especially adapted for burning dead oil;
but by using burners of suitable construction other oils may be burned,
and a superior quality of lamp-black made from mitigated spirits.</p>

<p>A very large proportion of the lamp-black now made is derived from the
combustion of creosote or anthracene oils from coal tar, or of the
residues of shale-oil distillation. The form of combustion chamber
varies in different works, but is typified by the following rough sketch
of that in use at the Stampshaw Chemical Works (<a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 11.&mdash;<i>Apparatus for making Lamp-black from Creosote
or Shale Oil.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>At these works a horizontal brick flue <i>a</i> about 18 inches square and
about 10 feet long is provided. At one end it enters the black-house
<i>b</i>, and is here provided with a damper <i>c</i> to shut it off when not
working. The other end opens to the air, and here is a sliding door <i>d</i>
which, when shut down, leaves an opening round a small pipe <i>e</i>, which
enters in this situation from a main pipe that conveys oil in a similar
manner to four burners of this description placed side by side. At the
bottom of the flue is an iron tray <i>f</i> to catch any liquid that falls
from the tube, and in this tray the oil is burned. The burning of oil in
one of these flues is not allowed to go on for more than three hours,
and, when the combustion is over, the communication with the black-house
is closed, the entrance door of the flue is opened, and the cover is
taken off the chimney <i>g</i> so that the flue may become cooled, and
another flue is taken into use.</p>

<p>The black-house is a brick chamber into which the smoke passes, and
where it deposits its sooty particles. In some works there is only one
undivided chamber; in other works there are more than one, and the
chambers communicate by flues through which the smoke passes from one to
another. At other works the chamber is divided by vertical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> partitions,
springing alternately from the two ends, so as to constitute one high
zigzag flue, along which the smoke must travel to its outlet from the
black-house. This chamber must needs have an opening somewhere to the
outer air. The opening is sometimes a small chimney in the roof, and
sometimes a short louvre tower. This is necessary to produce a trifling
draught, just enough to carry the smoke into the chamber and no more.</p>

<p>In some works, the black from the black-house is also calcined, the
object of the “calcination” being to get rid of all greasiness, a point
of great importance when the lamp-black is to be used for making fine
pigment. This process is conducted in circular iron pans, usually about
2¼ feet high and 2¼ feet diameter, which are provided with removable
iron covers. A pan of this size will hold about 2 lb. of lamp-black. A
bowlful is first put in and lighted by a red-hot iron; more and more is
added from time to time as the ignition proceeds. When the pan, being
full, leaves off smoking, the calcination is known to be complete, and
the pan is then covered and its contents are allowed to cool. The loss
undergone in this process is about 25 per cent. The smoke which comes
off is acrid and very irritating to the eyes, like that proceeding from
boiling oil, and it is difficult for a person unaccustomed to it to
remain many minutes in the chamber where calcining is going on. This
process is sometimes conducted within a chamber, but frequently under a
shed or even in a building freely open to the air.</p>

<p>There are three sources from which nuisance may arise in lamp-black
making: 1. The smoke which issues from the chimney of the black-house,
small as it sometimes is, often constitutes a nuisance to near
neighbours; but the nuisance is not a very serious one, and it does not
extend very far from the works, never to a greater distance than about
50 yards. The odour, even when but little smoke escapes, is oppressive
and suffocating in character, and resembles that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> diffused in a room by
a smoking table-lamp. It occasions headache, but is not otherwise
injurious to health. 2. A similar nuisance of suffocating smoke
sometimes proceeds from the burners, but this is when they are leaky or
when there is a deficiency of draught through the black-house, or when
the doors of the burning chambers do not shut closely, and when there is
much wind blowing past them. This nuisance chiefly occurs when the
burners are open to the air and merely protected by an open shed. 3. The
escape of acrolein and other offensive vapours from the calcining house.</p>

<p>The best mode of preventing nuisance from the black-house is so to
elongate the chamber as to give abundant opportunity for the soot to
deposit in the course of the smoke along it to the outlet, and by taking
means to consume by fire what little smoke escapes deposition. A most
effectual arrangement for the accomplishment of these ends is to have a
black-house 150 feet long, and so divided by partitions within as to
cause the smoke to traverse a distance of altogether 500 feet before it
finds an exit; the exit from the chamber communicating with a fire, in
which the last of the smoke is consumed, and which serves to assist in
regulating the draught through the chamber.</p>

<p>The regulation of the draught through the burner and black chamber is of
importance in order to avoid the escape of smoke from the burners. If
the draught be too great, too much black is lost from the chamber, but
if, on the other hand, it be too little, the smoke instead of passing
into the chamber will come out into the works and create a nuisance,
especially where the burners are erected in the open air, under
circumstances in which variation in the force of the wind cannot fail to
interfere with due regulation of draught. This part of the manufacture
should be conducted within a building of some sort.</p>

<p>The best mode of preventing nuisance from calcination is in operation at
Shackell &amp; Edwards’ works, in Hornsey Road, Islington. At these works
the black is calcined in a chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> 20 feet square and 25 feet in
greatest height, with a paved floor and arched roof. In the centre of
the roof is the opening where a fire was formerly placed, but which is
now closed by a sky-light, capable of being raised. The calcining pots
are ranged round this chamber, and a fan, employed to draw off the
vapours from the oil-boiling pans, is further utilised to draw off also,
from the upper part of the calcining-house, the vapours arising from the
calcination, and to drive them into the boiler fire, where they are
consumed. Calcination should always be conducted in a closed building
duly ventilated so as not to create nuisance.</p>

<p>The transport of lamp-black is effected in barrels or bags; when in the
latter, these should be previously soaked in water containing some clay
in suspension, which stops up the pores of the sacking, and thereby
prevents loss.</p>

<p>The particular virtue of lamp-black as a pigment lies in its state of
extremely fine division, which could not possibly be attained by
artificial means; this quality renders it invaluable as the basis of
black pigments, all of which contain it in a greater or less quantity.
Indian ink and printers’ ink are also composed principally of this
substance.</p>

<p><b>Unimportant Blacks.</b>&mdash;In addition to the recognised blacks already
noticed there are a number of other sources of black pigment which have
been drawn upon to a limited extent, or have been suggested as
substitutes for the standard articles. They only merit a short
description.</p>

<p><i>Aniline black</i> is prepared by adding an acidified (sulphuric) solution
of bichromate of potash to an aqueous solution of hydrochlorate of
aniline, and washing the precipitate. The cost is prohibitive.</p>

<p><i>Candle black</i> is candle smoke condensed on a cold plate.</p>

<p><i>Charcoal black</i> is finely-ground wood charcoal.</p>

<p><i>Coal black</i> has been suggested by grinding coal, but lacks the
requisite qualities of a pigment.</p>

<p><i>Cork black</i> is a very fine pigment prepared by calcining cork refuse.
Limited supply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>German black</i> is Frankfort black.</p>

<p><i>Iron black</i> is ground black sulphide of iron.</p>

<p><i>Lead black</i> is prepared by boiling lead fume in sulphide of soda
solution. It would probably be unstable on account of oxidation.</p>

<p><i>Manganese black</i> is ground oxide of manganese. It is costly, and dries
too quickly.</p>

<p><i>Prussian black</i> is calcined Prussian blue. It is not of a good colour,
nor economical.</p>

<p><i>Prussiate black</i> is the carbonaceous residue from making yellow
prussiate of potash. Used chiefly for decolorising syrups, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Spanish black</i> is cork black.</p>

<p><i>Tannin black</i> is proposed to be made by exhausting the tannin from
refuse leather and tanning agents, and adding alum and sulphate of iron.
The colour is blue-black, weak, and unstable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<b>BLUES.</b></h2>

<p><b>Cobalt Blues.</b>&mdash;Some of the compounds of cobalt with alumina, phosphoric
acid, silica, and tin, are remarkable for possessing a fine blue colour
of great permanency and indestructibility, and still find a limited
application. They are chiefly as follows:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p><span class="smcap">Cœruleum.</span>&mdash;This is a light-blue slightly greenish colour, with no purple
tendency in artificial light. It is non-granular, covers well, mixes
with water or oil, and is a good artists’ colour for sky effects. It is
permanent in strong sunlight and impure atmosphere, and resists acids
and alkalies at normal temperatures. Hot hydrochloric acid dissolves it,
and addition of water to the pale blue solution produces a violet red;
evaporation to dryness restores the original pigment. The green tint of
a nitric acid solution is due to iron and nickel impurites. Dilute
sulphuric acid causes partial decomposition of cœruleum, but it is proof
against caustic potash, acetic acid, and concentrated sulphuric acid.
Its composition is given as</p>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>There are several methods of preparing cœruleum:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) A solution of stannate of potash is added to one of cobalt. A blue
precipitate is thrown down, which, on washing, becomes first light-red
and then brown. When calcined at a white heat it assumes a blue colour.</p>

<p>(2) A solution of stannate of soda is mixed with a solution of nitrate
of cobalt, and the resulting precipitate calcined to bright redness
forms a blue pigment.</p>

<p>(3) Solutions of cobalt and tin are mixed and precipitated by soda, the
precipitate washed free from soda being calcined as in all the other
cases. The silicate of soda is the most satisfactory sodium salt for a
precipitant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cobalt Blue.</span>&mdash;This rich pure blue pigment is not alone permanent, but
actually develops its full intensity only after exposure to the air.
With age, however, it acquires a greenish tendency, and in artificial
light it inclines to a violet tint. It is proof against acids and
alkalies, and mixes particularly well with water. In combination with
other pigments it is unaltered and has no effect on them. Its tones are
different from those of ultramarine. It slowly decomposes when heated in
strong sulphuric acid, yielding a violet solution and a white
precipitate, which latter dissolves and affords a blue liquid on
dilution with water. It consists principally of about 80 per cent.
alumina, and 15 per cent. oxide of cobalt.</p>

<p>There are several ways of preparing it:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) By Thénard’s original process, roasted cobalt, from Tunaberg,
Sweden, is dissolved under heat in an excess of nitric acid. The
solution, evaporated nearly to dryness, is boiled in water, and the
deposit of arseniate of iron is filtered out. Into the filtrate is
poured a solution of basic phosphate of soda, which throws down a
precipitate of basic phosphate of cobalt, varying in hue from violet to
pink. This precipitate is washed on a filter, and, while still
gelatinous, 1 lb. of it is intimately mixed with 8 lb. of hydrated
alumina, recently precipitated by ammonia from a solution of
potash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>-alum. The mass is first dried to brittleness and then calcined
in a covered clay vessel for half an hour at a cherry-red heat. The
resultant blue pigment is stored in glass receptacles.</p>

<p>The preparation of the gelatinous alumina is conducted as follows. The
potash-alum is dissolved in at least three times as much water as is
necessary, and is then precipitated by an abundant excess of ammonia,
with frequent stirring. When settled, the supernatant liquor is siphoned
off, and the precipitate is thoroughly washed several times on a filter.</p>

<p>Thénard blue will vary in tint according to the proportions of alumina
used. A pure colour is obtained with 4-5 parts alumina to 1 of phosphate
of cobalt; a greenish hue with equal parts of alumina and cobalt salt;
and almost any intermediate tone by varying the proportions between
these limits.</p>

<p>(2) To 16 parts of gelatinous alumina add 1 part of arseniate of cobalt,
obtained by precipitating the solution of cobalt by arseniate of potash.</p>

<p>(3) A richer and more velvety blue is got by using oxide of cobalt and
substituting phosphate of lime for the alumina (Boullai-Marillac).</p>

<p>(4) Binder’s process is as follows:&mdash;Dissolve by boiling 6 lb. alum,
free from iron, in a leaden or earthenware vessel, and filter it into a
vat 5½ ft. high and 3 ft. across, one-third full of clean water.
Precipitate the alumina by solution of potash, fill up the vat with
water, settle, decant the clear liquor, and wash repeatedly till barium
chloride gives no precipitate. Dissolve ½ lb. sesquioxide of cobalt in
1½ lb. hydrochloric acid at 22° B., and evaporate to dryness. Dissolve
the residue in 3 lb. hydrochloric acid, and pass a stream of
sulphuretted hydrogen through it, to throw down any foreign metals.
Filter clear, evaporate again to dryness, and dissolve the residue in
enough water to produce 4½-5 lb. of solution. Next precipitate the
cobalt solution (3 to 6 lb., according to depth of tint required) by
ammonia, avoiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> excess. Wash the precipitate, and add it to the
water, holding the gelatinous alumina in suspension, stirring thoroughly
for ½ an hour. A reddish tint in the supernatant liquor shows that some
of the cobalt has been dissolved. Add a little ammonia, and allow the
precipitate to settle. Decant and add new waters repeatedly. Finally
collect on a fine filter cloth, drain, press, stove dry, and calcine for
2-2½ hours at red heat in clay crucibles: then cool, grind first in a
mill and then on a slab, and sift.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smalts.</span>&mdash;This pigment has not maintained its position in competition
with artificial ultramarine. Formerly it was very largely used to
correct the yellow tone of cottons, papers, and pottery. It has a pale
violet-blue tint, which, however, is not constant in artificial light.
Being a silicate it is very permanent, and proof against the action of
acids, alkalies, and sunlight, besides being inert when mixed with other
pigments. It can be used with either water or oil as a medium, but is
not a successful paint owing to its weak colouring power. It is
virtually a double silicate of cobalt and potash, or a cobalt glass,
containing a few impurities, of which the chief are aluminium, iron, and
lead oxides. The colour varies somewhat according as these impurities
fluctuate, and the finest ground sample is always the palest. It is
hardly ever adulterated, and the chief point to secure is that it be
ground to the finest possible degree.</p>

<p>Its manufacture is most extensively and successfully carried on in
Saxony. The raw materials used are cobalt speiss (an arsenide of cobalt
and iron), potash, and sand. The ore is broken up into convenient sized
pieces and roasted at red heat in a reverberatory furnace provided with
a tall shaft for discharging the sulphurous and arsenical fumes at a
high altitude. When the evolution of these fumes has ceased and the mass
begins to assume a pasty consistence, the roasted ore is removed from
the furnace, cooled, reduced to a fine pulverulent condition (then known
as “zaffre”) and passed through a silken sieve. Should it be necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 12.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Furnace for Roasting Cobalt Ores.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">the cobalt ore is first spalled and hand-picked to remove the ores of
foreign metals which are associated with it; and then reduced to a very
fine state in an edge runner or mortar mill, and freed from earthy
impurities by washing. The concentrated ore is then dried and
dead-roasted in small charges at a time (about 4 cwt.) in a specially
designed reverberatory furnace such as shown in <a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12</a>, of which <i>a</i> is
the hearth on which the ore is spread; <i>b</i>, the fireplace, the products
of combustion from which pass over the ore on the hearth, and thence
into the flues <i>c</i>, which repeatedly circle round the furnace so as to
provide abundant opportunity for the arsenious oxide derived from the
combustion (oxidation) of the arsenic in the ore to condense; this
highly poisonous arsenious oxide is collected in a solid form from the
flues at convenient intervals by means of the doors <i>d</i>. The ore is
charged and discharged at the door <i>e</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> roasting should not be
carried to such a point that the whole of the sulphur and arsenic are
removed when making smalts, as by leaving a portion of these substances
in the ore at this stage, the ultimate purification is better
accomplished.</p>

<p>The next stage is to fuse the roasted ore with potash and silica so as
to form a blue glass. The proportions in which the ingredients are mixed
depend upon the depth of colour in the zaffre operated upon and the tint
desired in the finished smalts; hence it is always determined by a
preliminary experiment, and is then most carefully adhered to, each
material being accurately weighed out. Only the best potash can be used,
as it must be quite free from soda, and iron or other metal; the effect
of soda is to render the blue greenish tinted. Quartz affords the
requisite silica, and is hand-picked to ensure freedom from alumina,
iron, and lime, which import dullness into the colour, and then ground
to a fine powder in an edge runner mill. The duly weighed quantities of
the several ingredients are intimately mixed in wooden or cement lined
vessels, so as to preclude the possibility of any metallic iron finding
its way in; and as a further protection against this risk a little white
arsenic is often added so that the iron may be carried down in the
regulus which is formed during the fusion in the crucible.</p>

<p>These crucibles are of refractory earthenware quite free from lime, and
measure about 18 inches across at top, gradually diminishing to 14
inches at bottom, so that an ordinary charge is about ¾ cwt. They are
placed in rows in a furnace which generally bears a close resemblance to
a glass furnace, the operation being very similar. The form of furnace
common in Saxony, where most of the smalts is made, is shown in <a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13</a>.
By means of a series of openings a in the walls of the furnace the pots
<i>b</i> are introduced on to the hearth of the furnace, whereupon the
openings <i>a</i> are bricked up again and remain closed during the
operation. The ingredients are charged into the pots <i>b</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">by means of long iron ladles which are introduced through the small
square apertures <i>c</i>, which can be temporarily closed by a half-brick or
other simple article. The fire is then lit in the fireplace <i>d</i>, and the
products of combustion circulate around the pots <i>b</i>, and finally escape
at the orifices <i>e</i> at the top of the furnace into flues leading to the
chimney <i>f</i>. After about 8 hours’ firing fusion commences in the pots,
whereupon the contents are thoroughly stirred by rods inserted through
the working holes <i>c</i>. The temperature is then increased till a white
heat is attained, this being necessary for the formation of a glass. The
fused mass is repeatedly sampled, and when it has become quite
homogeneous, and the regulus or speiss containing the iron, antimony,
bismuth, arsenic, copper, nickel, sulphur and other impurities has
completely separated itself and collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> at the bottom of the pots,
the blue glass is ladled out and dropped at once into cold water, by
which it is disintegrated and rendered very brittle ready for the
subsequent grinding. The regulus is then drawn off from the pots through
holes provided for the purpose, and removed by the orifices <i>g</i>, after
which the pots are ready for another charge. They ordinarily remain
serviceable for about six months.</p>

<p>The grinding needs to be done with great thoroughness, and is
accomplished partly by stamps and partly by edge-runner mills in the
presence of water. The particles as reduced are floated off by the water
to a series of settling tanks communicating one with another. The
portion which settles in the first of the series is too coarse for use,
and is returned to the edge-runner for further grinding; while the
portion in the last of the series possesses such a weak colour that it
is rejected, or put into the crucible to undergo a second fusion. The
selected portions are dried ready for the consumer.</p>

<p><b>Copper Blues.</b>&mdash;These form an unimportant class, being unstable and not
endowed with great colouring power. Their tint is pale and greenish, and
though opaque in water, they are not particularly so when mixed with
oil. Exposed to the action of sulphur or its compounds, whether present
as sulphuretted hydrogen in the air, or in combination with a metal,
forming another pigment with which they may be mixed, copper blues
undergo an important chemical change, the carbonates and oxides of
copper being converted into the sulphide, which is black. Under the
influence of heat too the blue carbonate will lose its carbonic acid,
and be turned into the black oxide. Ammonia and the acids dissolve them,
but other alkalies are resisted until heat is applied. The chief kinds
of copper blue are Bremen blue, cæruleum, lime blue, mountain blue,
Péligot’s blue, and blue verditer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bremen Blue.</span>&mdash;This is a more or less pure hydrated oxide of copper,
varying in its qualities according to the method of preparation. When
made by precipitating a neutral salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> of copper from solution, it forms
a dense and compact mass; whereas a porous and pulverulent pigment
results when basic and insoluble copper salts are treated with alkalies.</p>

<p>(1) The foundation of the manufacture of this colour was waste copper
scrap, such as ship’s sheathing, from which, in various ways, was
prepared a basic chloride or oxy-chloride. Some of the methods adopted
were:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) 100 lb. scrap copper, 99 lb. powdered sulphate of potash,
and 100 lb. salt, moistened with clean water; (<i>b</i>) 100 lb. copper
fragments, 60 lb. salt, and 30 lb. diluted sulphuric acid (3 volumes of
water to 1 of acid); (<i>c</i>) a solution of copper oxide (scales) in pure
hydrochloric acid poured over the scrap copper. The method (<i>a</i>)
produces a chloride of copper which, in contact with more metal, becomes
a sub-chloride; this, absorbing more oxygen from the air, is converted
into the basic green “oxide” of the factories. By the (<i>b</i>) process, the
hydrochloric acid set free, and the atmospheric oxygen produce the same
result. In the (<i>c</i>) process a similar effect is obtained.</p>

<p>It is of primary importance that no trace of this sub-chloride of copper
shall be allowed to remain, as it undergoes decomposition by caustic
alkalies, and throws down an orange-yellow sub-oxide of copper. Hence it
has sometimes been the practice to prepare the basic oxy-chloride twelve
months in advance, and to stir it frequently before use. Complete
oxidation, however, can be as satisfactorily accomplished by alternately
wetting and completely drying the mass.</p>

<p>An interesting phenomenon takes place during the transformation of this
green magma into a hydrated oxide of copper. On this magma being
introduced by degrees into a caustic potash or soda lye of about 22° B.,
the thoroughly washed and dried product is exceedingly fine, with great
covering power, and deepens on addition of a little water. When the
magma is diluted with an equal volume of water, and the mixture at once
poured into an excess of caustic lye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> with constant agitation, a few
minutes’ rest will suffice for the mass to assume a most compact
consistence. The colour thus produced, when washed and dried, is much
lighter in colour, and has less body. A blue derived from any of these
products is unsatisfactory as regards freshness and intensity of colour;
whereas by adding a small quantity of concentrated solution of sulphate
of copper to the magma before treating it with the alkaline lye,
apparently a highly basic sulphate of copper is produced which deepens
the colour.</p>

<p>A pigment with good body can be made in the following manner. To 100 lb.
of the thick magma of basic oxychloride add a concentrated solution of 7
lb. sulphate of copper, and then 40 lb. of a concentrated caustic lye
(32°-36° B,), with vigorous and rapid stirring, finally adding about 150
lb. of caustic lye at 20° B. When the decomposition is quite complete,
the precipitate is carefully washed, passed through a fine hair sieve,
and filtered. Drying is effected at a low temperature, to ensure that
the hydrated state of the oxide is not changed; and the air of the
drying chamber must be free from acid or sulphuretted vapours.</p>

<p>(2) If neutral nitrate of copper be decomposed by an insufficiency of
potash carbonate solution, the flocculent precipitate of copper
carbonate resulting is by degrees transformed into a sub-nitrate of
copper, which goes down as a heavy green powder. On treating this
sub-nitrate with a potassic solution of zinc oxide, a dark-blue coloured
pigment is formed, which is apparently a zincate of copper mixed with a
very small proportion of a highly basic nitrate of copper. Though very
light it has great covering power. In practice the manufacture is
conducted as follows.</p>

<p>Calcine copper scales in a reverberatory or muffle furnace till the
sub-oxide is entirely converted into protoxide, or until it dissolves in
nitric acid without evolving red nitrous fumes. Heat is applied to the
solution of nitrate of copper, which is decomposed by addition of a
clear solution of potash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> carbonate. After effervescence has subsided,
small doses of potash carbonate solution are added till but little
undecomposed copper is left. This residue is recovered by decanting the
clear liquor, and repeatedly washing the green precipitate with small
quantities of clean water, collecting all the washings, and finally
precipitating by potash solution. On introducing the green carbonate of
copper into a new solution of copper nitrate, it is transformed into a
basic salt. Crystals of nitrate of potash are obtained by evaporating
the previous liquors.</p>

<p>To obtain an economic solution of zinc oxide, clippings of metallic zinc
are treated with a solution of caustic potash or soda in a cast-iron
vessel. The immediate result is a disengagement of hydrogen, and
saturation of the alkali with zinc oxide, which behaves as an acid. The
cleared liquor serves for decomposing the basic nitrate of copper. The
pigment produced is a handsome blue, and the potash liquor can be
evaporated down till it yields crystals of saltpetre. The economy of
this method lies in producing nitric acid cheaply from soda nitrate and
obtaining saltpetre as a bye-product.</p>

<p>(3) An inferior and cheaper pigment is made in the following manner. To
a solution of copper sulphate add one of barium or calcium chloride till
a white precipitate ceases to go down, and from the cleared blue liquor
all the copper is precipitated by addition of fresh milk of lime.
Usually the weight of quicklime required is 20 per cent. of the copper
sulphate. The settled, washed, and dried precipitate is the pigment
desired. The cleared barium or calcium chloride solution may be used
anew as a precipitant for the next batch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæruleum.</span>&mdash;This name has been given to the beautiful blue pigment used
in Egyptian and Pompeian mural paintings, and exhibiting the same bright
blue after 1000 years’ exposure to the weather as when first used. Its
composition has been given by Fouqué as approximately 63½ per cent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
silica, 21 per cent. copper oxide, and 14 per cent. calcium oxide, and
he regards it as a double silicate of copper and calcium. It is supposed
to have been produced by fusing together copper ore, sand and lime, but
experiments have not yet resulted in a successful imitation of the
pigment, a difficulty being encountered in the fact that if too high a
temperature be permitted, destruction of the blue colour ensues, and a
green glass results instead. This is unfortunate, as its remarkably
bright and stable hue would make it very popular if it could be
manufactured at a moderate cost. It withstands sulphuretted hydrogen,
and even prolonged boiling with any of the acids or alkalies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lime Blue.</span>&mdash;This pigment is essentially a mixture of hydrated oxide of
copper and calcium sulphate. It resists the action of alkalies in the
cold, but turns black when boiled in caustic soda, and is completely
soluble in hydrochloric acid. Ultramarine has largely, if not entirely
usurped its place. There are several ways of making lime blue:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Any soluble copper salt the acid of which will make a soluble salt
with lime is suitable, the only precaution necessary being that if in
the decomposition of the copper and lime salts, the combination of the
whole of the sulphuric acid with the lime is not attained, there should
be an excess of copper sulphate in the liquor rather than of the lime
salt. The resulting copper solution, containing very little lime
sulphate, is settled in a cool place for 24-36 hours, filtered, and
diluted with clean water down to about 18° B. Meantime a milk of lime is
prepared with very white and well-burned lime, slaked and mixed with
abundance of pure water, and kept stirred for a long time in a
lead-lined vat. After a short rest to permit sand, &amp;c., to precipitate
itself, the milk is drawn off, and left to settle in lead-lined or
copper pans. The deposit is collected, ground in a mill where contact
with iron is impossible, and passed through a very fine sieve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The mixture of lime and copper solution is made in the proportion of 100
lb. dry lime with 175 dry copper salt, if the most intense coloration is
desired, but the proportion of lime may be much increased without
detriment to the pigment beyond lessening its intensity of colour. After
complete settlement of the precipitate, the clear liquor is decanted;
the pigment is carefully washed with clean soft water, and drained on
filter cloths till it is of a convenient consistence forming a green
paste. A definite weight of this paste calculated on the dry pigment is
taken for further incorporation, consequently it is first necessary to
ascertain how much water is in the paste. Usually it amounts to 75 per
cent., and on this basis 5 lb. of the paste are stirred up with 1 gal.
clean water in a lead-lined vat, with addition of ½ lb. wet lime under
constant agitation. Subsequently ¼ pint of clear solution of best potash
at 15° B. is well stirred in, and the mixture is immediately taken to
the mill and most thoroughly ground.</p>

<p>Further, for each 10 gal. of green paste is prepared a clear solution of
1 lb. pure salammoniac in 2 gal. water and another solution of 2 lb.
copper sulphate in 2 gal. water. The liquid paste is drawn off from the
mill into a stoneware vessel, and the two solutions of salammoniac and
copper sulphate are immediately added. After complete agitation and
combination, the mixture is left for 4 or 5 days to settle, and turned
into a lead-lined vat, where it is repeatedly washed with clean waters
until turmeric paper is not discoloured.</p>

<p>(2) Precipitation of copper sulphate by excess of thin milk of lime in
the cold, followed by washing and drying, will give a lime blue which
will dry without turning black. Or 100 lb. of the copper sulphate may be
treated with a milk of lime prepared from 30 lb. quicklime and addition
of 12½ lb. salammoniac. When the liquor has become colourless, the
pigment is prepared from the precipitate; but the lime should be ground
after slaking, and the milk of lime left to stand for some days, before
use. The salammoniac seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> to be essential to the production of a pure
full blue. Milk of lime poured drop by drop into the ammoniacal copper
solution gives a precipitate which redissolves on agitation, and remains
long in solution under heat, but finally throws down a permanent
precipitate, while the liquor on standing gives beautiful blue crystals.
From experiments it appears that out of seven atoms of copper sulphate
in the liquor, five are precipitated by milk of lime and the last two
are decomposed by ammonia. A greater proportion of lime will produce a
precipitate holding a certain quantity of less valuable pigment. A
smaller proportion of lime yields a finer coloured and more crystalline
pigment, because it crystallises partly in the excess of solution, so
that by incomplete decomposition a smaller yield of superior pigment is
obtained. The proportions necessary for formation of the colour are 7
equivalents of copper sulphate, 5 of lime, and 2 of ammonia, and if the
2 equivalents of ammonia be replaced by 2 of lime and 2 of salammoniac,
the proportions furnishing the best colour will be 100 lb. copper
sulphate, 24 lb. lime, and 22½ lb. salammoniac.</p>

<p>Both caustic soda and caustic potash produce a fine blue precipitate in
a solution of ammoniacal copper sulphate with excess of ammonia, but the
liquor decolorises only on evaporation of the ammonia. The precipitate
becomes lighter-hued the more it is washed, and consists of hydrated
oxide of copper with a little carbonic acid; it does not turn brown even
when heated in presence of excess of potash or soda. Moreover the
presence of ammonia renders the hydrated oxide of copper much more
permanent. The composition of this pigment is given by Gentele as 33½
per cent. copper oxide, 23½ sulphuric acid, 16 lime, and the remainder
water, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mountain Blue or Azurite.</span>&mdash;This natural blue pigment consists
essentially of a basic carbonate of copper, and is found in quartz rocks
in England, France, Bohemia, Hesse, Saxony, the Tyrol, and Siberia. It
affords a rich sky-blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> paint of a permanent character, but being
comparatively costly is not largely employed. Its composition is about
69 per cent. copper oxide, 25½ carbonic acid, and 5 water. The only
preparation needed is exceedingly fine grinding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Péligot Blue.</span>&mdash;(1) Whereas the hydrated oxide of copper precipitated
from a solution of a salt of copper by excess of potash or soda rapidly
blackens even though washed with cold water, Péligot obtains a blue
hydrated oxide which resists boiling and heating at 212° F. He uses any
soluble copper salt, but preferably the sulphate. A very dilute solution
of the copper sulphate is treated with ammonia in excess (aqua ammoniæ
or an ammoniacal salt) and precipitated by soda or potash.</p>

<p>(2) On adding water in excess to a slightly ammoniacal solution of
copper nitrate, the same pigment is obtained.</p>

<p>(3) A mixture of 73 parts silica, 16 oxide of copper, 8 lime, and 3
soda, is fused together at a temperature not much exceeding 800° F. At
higher temperatures there is risk of the pigment turning black.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Verditer.</span>&mdash;This sky-blue and not very durable pigment, used in
water-colour painting, closely resembles Bremen blue (see <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>) in
composition and manufacture. It consists chiefly of copper carbonate,
mixed with a lesser proportion of hydroxide, sulphate, or oxide, and
occasionally a small quantity of sulphate of lime; and is most
satisfactorily prepared from copper chloride or nitrate, though almost
any salt of copper may be used. The mode of fabrication varies.</p>

<p>(1) To a solution of the nitrate or sulphate is added one of potash or
soda carbonate so long as any precipitate is formed, and this
precipitate, when filtered and washed, is treated with a weak caustic
soda solution.</p>

<p>(2) A hot solution of chloride of lime is added to a hot solution of
sulphate of copper at 62½° Tw. till the precipitate ceases to go down.
The solution of chloride of copper which constitutes the liquor is
filtered off, diluted with water to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> about 31½° Tw., and treated with
repeated small doses of slaked lime ground exceedingly fine in water
till no more copper is precipitated. The resulting green paste is
drained, filtered, washed, and put into wooden vats; here 8 lb. of lime
paste and 5 pints of potash carbonate solution at 25½° Tw. are added for
every 70 lb. of <i>dry</i> colour contained in the green paste, the whole
mass being thoroughly agitated, then allowed to rest till the
development of the required shade is accomplished, when it is filtered,
washed, and dried.</p>

<p>(3) In some German works the final green paste as prepared in (2) is put
into air-tight vessels, and a solution of 3 lb. ammonium chloride and 4
lb. sulphate of copper in 7 gal. of water is introduced for each 70 lb.
of <i>dry</i> colour in the green paste. After complete admixture of all the
ingredients, the receptacles are fastened up for several days so that
the reactions may proceed out of contact with the air, and finally the
pigment is removed, washed, and dried for use.</p>

<p><b>Indigo.</b>&mdash;The well-known blue colouring matter termed indigo is produced
by a great number and variety of plants, distributed throughout all the
tropical countries of the globe. Commercially, it is obtained chiefly
from species of <i>Indigofera</i>, as <i>I. tinctoria</i>, the cultivated species
of India, furnishing the chief article of commerce, found also in
Madagascar, St. Domingo, &amp;c.; and <i>I. Anil</i>, in the Punjab, W. Indies,
and on the Gambia river. Some is also obtained from <i>I. argentea</i>, in
Africa and America: <i>I. Caroliniana</i>; <i>I. disperma</i>, the cultivated
plant of Spain, America, and some of the E. Indies; <i>I. cærulea</i>, the
“black indigo” of India; <i>I. glauca</i>, in Egypt and Arabia; <i>I.
pseudo-tinctoria</i>, cultivated in some parts of the E. Indies, and said
to yield the best dye; <i>I. cinerea</i>, <i>I. erecta</i>, <i>I. hirsuta</i>, and <i>I.
glabra</i>, in Guinea. Considerable local supplies are obtained from the
following plants:&mdash;<i>Isatis tinctoria</i>, in Europe and China (see Woad);
<i>I. indigotica</i>, cultivated in some parts of China; <i>Amorpha fruticosa</i>,
in Carolina; <i>Baptisia tinctoria</i>, wild, in the United States;
<i>Gymnemia</i> (<i>Asclepias</i>) <i>tingens</i>, in Burmah; <i>Polygala tinctoria</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> in
Arabia; <i>Polygonum Chinense</i>, <i>P. tinctorium</i>, <i>P. perfoliatum</i>, <i>P.
barbatum</i>, <i>P. aviculare</i>, in China and Japan, and introduced into
Belgium; <i>Ruellia indigotica</i>, largely cultivated in Assam, as well as
in India, and at Che-king, in China; <i>Tephrosia tinctoria</i>, and <i>T.
apollinea</i>, in India and Egypt; <i>Wrightia tinctoria</i> (<i>Nerium
tinctorium</i>), the Palas indigo of the Carnatic.</p>

<p>The cultivation of indigo (chiefly <i>Indigofera tinctoria</i>) is very
extensively carried on in India, especially in the district included
between 20° and 30° N. lat. The soil best suited for the culture is a
rich loam, with a subsoil which is neither too sandy nor too stiff;
alluvial soils give the best returns, but good crops are sometimes
raised on higher grounds. The land is ploughed in October-November,
after the rains; the seed, about 12 lb. to the acre, is sown in
February-April. Too rapid growth diminishes the yield of dye. In
July-September, the plants are in full blossom, and the harvest takes
place. The preparation of the dyestuff may be performed in either of two
ways, which are distinguished as the “dry-leaf,” and the “green-leaf”
process. The latter is considered the better, and is the more general;
it is conducted as follows:&mdash;The flowering plants are cut down at about
6 in. from the ground, and immediately taken to the steeping vats,
within which they are spread out and pressed down by beams fitted to the
side posts of the tanks. Enough water is then admitted to cover the
plants; if this be delayed, fermentation may set in and spoil the
product. The duration of the steeping is liable to considerable
modification, and needs much judgment and experience; with a temperature
of 96° F. in the shade, 11-12 hours may suffice; in cooler weather,
15-16 hours may be necessary. Moreover, very ripe plants require less
time than young and unripe ones. The following general conditions
indicate the time for suspending the maceration:&mdash;(1) The sinking of the
water in the vat; (2) the immediate bursting of the bubbles that arise;
(3) an orange tint mingled with the green, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> the surface water is
disturbed; (4) the emission of a sweetish, pungent odour, quite distinct
from the raw odour of the unripe liquor. At this point, men enter the
vat, and stir up its contents either by hand or by a wooden paddle. The
agitation is at first gentle, but increases as the fecula begins to
separate; this is known by the disappearance of the froth, and by the
colour of the liquor changing from green to blue. The “beating,” as it
is called, is continued for 1¾-3 hours, the following conditions being a
guide as to its sufficiency:&mdash;(1) The ready precipitation of the fecula
from a sample of the liquor, and the madeira-wine colour of the latter;
(2) a brownish colour observed on dipping a cloth into the liquor, and
wringing it out; (3) the appearance of a glassy surface on the liquor,
and the subsidence of the froth with sparkling and effervescence.</p>

<p>Next a little pure cold water, or weak lime-water, is sprinkled over the
surface of the liquor, to hasten the settlement of the fecula, which
occupies 3-4 hours. After this, the water is drained away from the top,
by means of plug-holes in the side of the vat. The precipitated fecula
is then removed to a boiler. Here it is made to boil as promptly as
possible, and is kept boiling for 5-6 hours; it is constantly stirred,
and skimmed with a perforated ladle. After boiling, it is run off to a
straining table, where it stays for 12-15 hours to drain; next it is
pressed for about 12 hours, and then cut, stamped, and placed to dry.
The ordinary dimensions of a steeping-vat are 16 ft. by 14 ft. by 4½ ft.
deep; this will contain about 100 <i>maunds</i> (8200 lb.) of plants, which
may yield from 40 lb. downwards of indigo. The beating-vat is less deep.</p>

<p>Such are the methods of cultivation and manufacture most generally in
use throughout India. In limited districts, however, some modifications
are in vogue. On land subject to inundation, the plants last only one
year. South of the Ganges, the seed is sown at the beginning of the
rains, and the plants remain on the ground for two years, thus giving a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
double crop, the second of which is the larger and better. In very
strong land, a third crop is sometimes secured. Occasionally, sesame is
sown on the same ground, and harvested before the indigo is cut. Small
quantities of indigo are grown on poppy lands, and irrigated. The seed
is sown in March-April, and the crop is gathered at the end of the
rains, in time for an opium crop to be taken off the land. Indigo is
sometimes manufactured by collecting the fecula, and dropping it in
cakes to harden in the sun; this is “gaud” indigo, of very inferior
quality. The fecula is improved by boiling it in coppers and pressing it
into boxes. The production of the indigo blue is the result of the
decomposition of the colouring principle of the plant, which exists as a
glucoside. Plants grown on poor soils, and in dry climates, yield almost
the whole of this glucoside to the ordinary process of steeping and
beating described above; but plants raised on rich alluvial soil, and in
damp heat, contain an amount of glucoside which cannot be utilised by
the ordinary process. In order to prevent this waste, which causes the
richest plants to give the least return, it is necessary either to
prolong the fermentation, and raise the heat to 95°-100° F., or to add a
solution of sugar or glucose to the vat-liquor. Olphert adopts the use
of steam, to raise the temperature of the vat to 111° F., and thus
obtains 25 per cent. more colouring matter.</p>

<p>Japan possesses several large factories for preparing indigo from the
native <i>Polygonum tinctorium</i>. The plants, 2-3 ft. high, are cut into
three parts, the uppermost being the most valuable. The best dye is made
from the leaves alone, which, after a few hours’ exposure to air and
sun, are placed in straw bags. They are afterwards removed from the bags
and moistened with water, which must be proportioned with the greatest
exactitude. They are then spread upon, and covered by, mats, for a few
days, after which the sprinkling is repeated. The process continues for
about 80 days, the moistening being renewed about 25 times for the best
leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> and 9 for the inferior. After this fermentation, the leaves are
pounded in wooden mortars for two consecutive days, by which they are
reduced to a pulp; this is then formed into balls of dark-blue colour.</p>

<p>The central provinces of Java yield large quantities of indigo, which
are exported to Holland, and thence widely distributed. The indigo
prepared by the natives is of an indifferent quality, in a semi-fluid
state, and contains much quicklime; but that prepared by Europeans is of
a very superior quality. An inferior variety, having smaller seeds, and
being of quicker growth, is usually planted as a second crop on land
where one rice crop has been raised. In these situations, the plant
rises to a height of about 3½ ft. It is then cut, and the cuttings are
repeated three, or even four times, till the ground is again required
for the annual rice crop. But the superior plant, when cultivated on a
naturally rich soil, not impoverished by a previous heavy crop, attains
a height of 5 ft., and grows with the greatest luxuriance. The plants
intended for seed are raised in favourite spots, on the ridges of
rice-fields in the neighbourhood of the villages, and the seed of one
district is frequently exchanged for that of another. That of the rich
mountainous districts, being esteemed of best quality, is occasionally
introduced into the lowlands, and is thought necessary to prevent that
degeneration which would be the consequence of cultivating for a long
time the same plant upon the same soil. The climate, soil, and state of
society of Java seem to offer peculiar advantages for the extensive
cultivation of this plant. The periodical droughts and inundations of
the Bengal provinces are unknown in Java, where the plant, in favoured
situations, may be cultivated nearly throughout the whole year, and
where it would be secure of a prolonged period of that kind of weather
necessary for the cutting. The dye is prepared in a liquid state by the
natives, by infusing the leaves with a quantity of lime; in this state,
it forms by far the principal dye-stuff of the country. The indigos
prepared in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> Java by Sayers’s process are of unusually high and constant
quality. They contain an average of 70½ per cent. of indigotine, and a
minimum of 65-66 per cent.; and an average of 2·77 per cent. of ash.
Ordinary commercial indigos seldom attain 65-66 per cent. of indigotine;
and their ash averages about 16½ per cent.</p>

<p>The Philippines produce considerable quantities of indigo, the best
coming from Luzon. The plants suffer from locusts and storms, but the
cultivation is very profitable. The yield of indigotine is large, but
the preparation is conducted in such a primitive manner that the value
of the product is much deteriorated.</p>

<p>In many parts of Africa, as Sierra Leone, Liberia, Abeokuta, the Niger
valley, Natal, Cape Colony, Tunis, and the Soudan, species of indigo
plants are found in a wild state, and from them the natives prepare an
inferior dye-stuff.</p>

<p>In some of the S. States of America, notably S. Carolina, indigo culture
has been attended with more or less success. The method of preparation
pursued here varies but very slightly from the ordinary Indian process,
almost the only important modification being the addition of a little
oil to the liquor in the beating-vat, when the fermentation becomes too
violent. The precipitated fecula is placed in coarse linen bags, and
hung up to drain. The drying is finished by turning it out of the bags
upon a floor of porous timber, and working it up. It is frequently
exposed to the sun for short periods at morning and evening, and is then
placed in boxes or frames, to cure till it is fit for the market.</p>

<p>Several of the Central American States have figured conspicuously as
indigo producers. The dye is precipitated in the beating-vat by the sap
contained in the bark of Tihuilate (<i>Yonidium</i>), Platanillo (<i>Myrosma
Indica</i>), or Cuaja tinta. The fecula is left during the night; and, on
the following day, is boiled, filtered, pressed, and sun-dried. In most
districts, the cultivation is declining, partly owing to the
carelessness exhibited in the preparation of the dye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Indigo is judged commercially by its lightness, by a copper gloss on the
surface, and by exhibiting no foreign ingredients when broken. There are
several ways of testing it chemically, to ascertain the exact proportion
of indigotine present; one method is as follows:&mdash;Finely pulverised
indigo, 1 part; green copperas, 2 parts; and water containing 10 per
cent. of caustic soda, 200 parts; are well boiled in a flask, and left
to cool. The clear liquor is exposed in shallow vessels to the air, when
the soluble indigo is oxidised, and precipitated as pure indigotine. The
residue in the flask is thus treated three times; the whole indigotine
is then collected on a filter, dried, and weighed. The consumption of
indigo is still very large. Artificial indigo has not, as yet, been
manufactured on a commercial scale, nor at a commercial price; but it
has been produced, in the laboratory, from coal-tar derivatives, and
further experiment may reveal a process for preparing the article at a
sufficiently low price to compete with the natural colour.</p>

<p>Several preparations of indigo are in use:&mdash;(1) Sulphopurpuric acid,
phenicine, or indigo-purple, is made by mixing 1 part of indigo with 4
parts of sulphuric acid (sp. gr. 1·845), and heating for ½-1 hour; the
acid mass is thrown into 40-50 parts of water, when the purple falls
down; it is collected on a filter, and washed with dilute hydrochloric
acid. (2) Sulphindigotic acid is prepared by mixing indigotine, 1 part,
with sulphuric acid (sp. gr. 1·845) 6 parts; the operation must be
performed in a leaden vessel, cooled outside, and the indigo must be
added by degrees, to avoid heating; the mixture is then left for 8 days,
when the conversion will be complete. Fuming or anhydrous acid may be
used, in less proportion, but the reaction is more difficult to manage.
Weaker acid will require a longer period, say a month for “brown acid”
(145° Tw.). (3) Sulphindigotic acids are transformed into neutral paste,
or “carmine,” by neutralising with carbonate of soda, and washing the
paste, on a woollen filter, with a solution of chloride of sodium
(common salt).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Manganese Blue.</b>&mdash;(1) Kuhlmann found a blue mass of manganate of lime in
furnaces used for making calcium chloride by calcining a mixture of
chalk and residues from chlorine making. The formation of this beautiful
coloured manganate he attributes to the decomposition of the calcium
chloride by steam, and to a certain solubility of the lime in
undecomposed calcium chloride. Unsuccessful attempts to reproduce this
result were apparently due to the lime not being under such favourable
conditions for acting upon the manganese oxide as when it is in solution
in the calcium chloride. As accidentally produced in reverberatory
furnaces, the manganate of lime is of an ultramarine tint, and is
insoluble in water though not permanent under its influence; it is acted
upon by the weakest acids.</p>

<p>(2) Bong has proposed several formulæ for making manganese blues, the
ingredients in each case being heated to redness in an oxidising
atmosphere, taking special care to avoid iron. The following are his
recipes:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) 6 parts soda ash, 5 of calcium carbonate, 3 of silica,
and 3 of manganese oxide; (<i>b</i>) 8 of barium nitrate, 2 of kaolin, and 3
of manganese oxide; (<i>c</i>) 8 of barium nitrate, 3 of silica, and 3 of
manganese oxide. The tint can be varied from violet to green by altering
the proportions.</p>

<p><b>Prussian Blue.</b>&mdash;This blue owes its colour to a combination of iron and
ferrocyanogen. The commercial products vary very much in tint, depth of
colour, covering power, and solubility. They are used for a variety of
purposes, nearly all of which require the blue to have some property
different from what it should have for other uses. For some purposes a
green shade blue is wanted, for others a violet shade blue; some users
want the blue to be soluble in water, others for it to be soluble in
oxalic acid, others require it to be insoluble. Ordinary Prussian blue
is insoluble in water, acids, and alkaline salts; bleaching powder has
no action on it, and therefore it is largely used for tinting paper. It
is capable of resisting acids; but alkalies, such as caustic soda,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
caustic potash, the carbonates of the same metals, lime and ammonia,
decompose it, oxide of iron and a solution of a ferrocyanide of the
alkali being formed, the decomposition being shown by a change of colour
from blue to a reddish brown. On this account Prussian blues cannot be
used for colouring soaps and alkaline products, or used as a pigment in
distemper painting along with lime. The change of colour, from blue to
brown, by the action of alkalies, distinguishes this blue from other
blues.</p>

<p>Prussian blues require to be tested for their solubility in oxalic acid,
by taking about 20 gr. of the blue, mixing with 1 oz. of water and 20
gr. of oxalic acid, in which a good blue ought to dissolve completely.
Some brands are soluble in strong hydrochloric acid while others are
not. It is decomposed by boiling sulphuric acid, and turned green by
boiling nitric acid. For all the ordinary uses of a pigment Prussian
blue is quite durable, and possesses a depth of colour and a definite
tint which is proof against the destructive agencies of light and air;
and though its covering powers are not great, it is one of the most
important blue pigments in use.</p>

<p>When a salt of the higher oxide of iron is added to a solution of yellow
prussiate of potash (or ferrocyanide of potassium) a blue compound is
formed which is called Prussian blue. But this is not the method adopted
for its commercial manufacture. In that case a ferrous salt, the
proto-sulphate of iron, is added to a potassium ferrocyanide solution,
the result of which is that a dirty bluish white precipitate is thrown
down. On adding to this a little solution of bichromate of potash and
sulphuric acid, the full deep blue is obtained. This is the industrial
method of manufacturing Prussian blue.</p>

<p><i>Yellow Prussiate.</i>&mdash;The first step is the preparation of the yellow
prussiate of potash. The manufacture of this substance, although an
industry of considerable importance, is comparatively little understood,
either from a scientific or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> practical point of view. At all events,
many prussiate makers seem completely at sea with regard to the most
favourable conditions for carrying on the manufacture, and there can be
no doubt that in many cases great waste occurs, through ignorance of the
various reactions which take place during the process. The raw materials
usually consist of carbonate of potash, iron filings or turnings, and
organic matters containing carbon and nitrogen&mdash;such as dried blood,
woollen rags, horn, hair, leather scraps, &amp;c. The most suitable
substances for use are, of course, those containing the largest
proportion of nitrogen. The following are the percentages of nitrogen in
various kinds of animal matter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="nind">Animal matters always contain more carbon than is necessary for the
formation of cyanogen by combining with the nitrogen also present.
Consequently, when such substances are heated with pearlash, the excess
of carbon reduces a portion of the carbonate to the metallic state, and
this potassium combines with the cyanogen to produce potassium cyanide.
The manufacture of yellow prussiate of potash may be conveniently
divided into three stages: (1) The production of the molten mass
technically known as “metal”; (2) the lixiviation; and (3) the
crystallisation.</p>

<p>(1) The “metal” is made by fusing animal matters with pearlash, almost
invariably with the addition of iron scrap. The animal substances are
sometimes used in their original condition, whilst sometimes they are
previously charred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> Generally speaking, however, a judicious mixture of
the fresh and charred materials has been found to give the best results.
The charcoal which is left on carbonising animal matters contains a
certain amount of nitrogen, decreasing in proportion as the temperature
rises; but a smaller quantity of charcoal is also thereby produced. For
example: 100 parts of rags carbonised at a certain temperature left 75
parts charcoal containing 12 per cent. of nitrogen, while the same rag
carbonised at a higher temperature yielded 25 parts of charcoal, which
contained only 2 per cent. of nitrogen. The animal matters employed
should not leave much ash on ignition, as this would both thicken the
mass and decompose a portion of the potash. In this respect sand is
specially objectionable, for on ignition 1 part will decompose 2 of
pearlash, owing to formation of silicate of potash. It is not necessary
that the pearlash should be quite pure; in fact, a certain proportion of
sulphate is stated to be useful, as it is changed into sulphide by
ignition with the carbonaceous materials.</p>

<p>The theory of the formation of yellow prussiate of potash may be briefly
stated as follows: The carbonate and sulphate of potash react with the
carbon, nitrogen, and iron, forming in the first instance sulphide of
potassium, which afterwards converts the iron into sulphide, whilst
potassium cyanide is simultaneously produced. It should be here
explained that ferrocyanide of potassium (yellow prussiate) is not
formed during the ignition of the above mentioned materials, but results
from the lixiviation of the fused mass with water, when the cyanide of
potassium and iron sulphide decompose each other, producing ferrocyanide
and sulphide of potassium. It is quite obvious that even if any
ferrocyanide were produced during the process of fusion, it would almost
immediately be decomposed, at the intense heat to which the mass is
subjected, into potassium cyanide, iron carbide, and nitrogen gas. If
any doubt were felt on this point, the experiments of Liebig
conclusively prove that the formation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> of ferrocyanide takes place on
dissolving the ignited mass in water, but not previously. Liebig found
that if the fused mixture be allowed to cool, and then treated with
moderately strong alcohol, potassium cyanide alone is extracted, and the
residue when dissolved in water no longer yields ferrocyanide. As
ferrocyanide is not formed during the process of fusion, the presence of
iron in the preliminary stages may appear superfluous; but such is not
the case. The presence of iron is necessary for two reasons, firstly,
because the sulphate of potash which is generally present is converted
into sulphide and bisulphide, and these, in the absence of iron, would
decompose some of the cyanide of potash into sulphocyanate, thereby
causing a loss of cyanogen so far as yellow prussiate is concerned; and
secondly, because potassium bisulphide has a very corrosive action on
the iron pot in which the fusion takes place. When iron is present it
readily decomposes any alkaline sulphides, thereby preventing formation
of sulphocyanate, and being itself converted into iron sulphide, which
is again changed into prussiate by the action of the aqueous cyanide.</p>

<p>Pear-shaped iron pots were formerly used for fusing the raw materials.
The arrangement now generally adopted in large English works consists of
a series of iron pots almost hemispherical in shape, set in brickwork,
and each heated by a separate fire and circular flue. These vessels are
closed by iron lids, with apertures for the admittance of animal
matters, the aperture being at once closed by a slide after each
addition. Through every lid there passes a vertical spindle, carrying a
set of blades for mixing the materials, and set in motion by a suitable
shaft worked by steam power. Instead of the ordinary iron pots,
reverberatory furnaces are often employed, especially in Germany. The
reason for this preference is, that ordinary iron vessels are worn out
in a comparatively short time, the destructive action being greatest on
the under surface of the muffle. A much larger quantity of raw material
can also be operated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> upon at one time if a reverberatory furnace be
used. The mode of procedure depends to some extent upon the condition of
the organic materials employed. If fresh, the muffle or furnace must be
left open, so as to permit the mixture to be well and frequently
stirred, and additions to be made at intervals until eventually ammonia
ceases to be evolved. The furnaces are arranged in such a manner that
when the carbonate of potash has once become fused the doors of the
fire-place may be shut, and no fresh firing is required during the
introduction of the animal matters. The molten mass is kept well stirred
by means of a thick iron bar, suspended by a chain, and fixed in an
aperture in the side of the furnace. By the use of this arrangement the
stirring is much more easily and thoroughly effected than is the case
with the old fashioned pots. Ordinary reverberatory furnaces cannot be
used for the fusion, because the silica in the hearth would combine with
the potash to form silicate of potash. Gas generators with air blast are
now sometimes employed instead of ordinary fuel in the manufacture of
yellow prussiate of potash. Several advantages are gained by operating
in this manner, especially that of permitting the regulation of
temperature and the admission of oxygen, so as to obtain an ordinary, a
neutral, or a reducing flame, according to requirements. In the
preparation of the “metal,” for every 100 parts of pearlash from 100 to
125 parts of fresh animal substances are required, together with 6 or 8
parts of iron in some form or other. The pearlash, or a mixture of 1
part of pearlash with 2 to 4 parts “blue salt” or “blue potash” (this
substance will be referred to later on), is melted in the furnace and
heated to bright redness, so that the temperature of the mass may not be
reduced too much by the addition of the animal matters. These, in their
original condition, or an equivalent quantity of carbonised materials,
together with the proper proportion of iron, are then introduced&mdash;first
pretty frequently, afterwards at longer intervals. Each addition of
animal matter causes a somewhat violent frothing and escape of
combustible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> gases, along with water and carbonic acid, and the whole
becomes thick&mdash;not so much owing to the introduction of solid substances
as by the fall of temperature, resulting from the production of such
large quantities of gas. In order to hasten the decomposition, vigorous
stirring must be applied. When the reaction is at an end, the semi-fluid
mass is transferred to cast-iron dishes, and the furnace is again filled
with carbonate of potash and heated. In this way four or five charges
may be accomplished every day, and the process carried on continuously.
The most favourable conditions for effecting the melting part of the
process are attained when the heat approaches whiteness, and a bright,
clear flame is produced as soon as the raw materials are introduced.
According to one authority, woollen rags and good pearlash, with a small
proportion of waste iron, have produced the largest yield of yellow
prussiate, although even in this case two-thirds of the total nitrogen
present was lost in the form of ammonia.</p>

<p>(2) Lixiviation.&mdash;The fused mass, if properly prepared, should yield
about 16 per cent. of prussiate on dissolving in water. In this part of
the process, the “metal” when cold is broken into lumps and placed in
cold water mixed with the weak lyes from former operations. Heat is then
applied until the temperature rises to about 180°-190° F., and the
liquid is stirred vigorously so as to promote rapid solution, because
some of the potassium cyanide is apt to be decomposed during
lixiviation. When the solution attains a density of 30°-40° Tw. it is
left to clarify, the heat being withdrawn. The clear solution is
decanted, and evaporated in pans, which are generally heated by the
waste heat of the furnaces. When it has a density of 54° Tw. it is run
off into the crystallisers, where it deposits the crude salt.</p>

<p>(3) Crystallisation.&mdash;This is a very important stage of the manufacture,
as it is the final process by which the crude prussiate is rendered
sufficiently pure to be placed on the market. The impure substance is
dissolved in warm water until the solution stands at 54° Tw.; after all
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>soluble matter has deposited, the clear liquor is placed in the
crystallising vessels. These are occasionally made of wood; but when
such vessels are used, the crystallised salt generally possesses a green
colour, which is believed to be due to the tannin present in the wood.
On this account cast-iron crystallisers are more frequently employed.
The crystallisation proceeds slowly&mdash;often going on for several weeks in
large vessels. The mother liquor is then drawn off, and if not too
impure is used for dissolving fresh quantities of the crude prussiate.
The ferrocyanide is deposited in crusts in the crystallisers; but by
hanging lumps of the solid salt in the solution, long clusters of
crystals may be obtained, and by suspending these in fresh prussiate
lyes immense crystals are produced. From 100 parts crude prussiate about
90 parts pure potassium ferrocyanide are obtained, or sometimes in the
case of purer materials 97 parts.</p>

<p>Sulphate of potash is often present in commercial yellow prussiate. The
separation of this impurity is best effected on the large scale by
evaporating the prussiate solution to a density of 62° Tw., at which
point most of the sulphate will crystallise out. If the clear liquor be
then drawn off, diluted to 52° Tw., and allowed to cool, almost pure
potassium ferrocyanide will gradually deposit. This may be rendered
absolutely pure by gently fusing the crystals, dissolving in water, and
treating with a small quantity of acetic acid, which will decompose any
carbonates and cyanides. On adding sufficient strong alcohol, the
ferrocyanide is precipitated, and when crystallised once or twice more
from water it may be regarded as chemically pure.</p>

<p>Blue salt.&mdash;This substance, to which we have previously referred, is a
residue obtained in the manufacture of prussiate of potash. The last
mother-liquor contains a large quantity of carbonate of potash, along
with smaller amounts of hydrate, silicate, chloride, and sulphocyanate.
It is concentrated until the liquid has a density of 90° Tw., when most
of the chloride, silicate, &amp;c., separates out, and the strong liquor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
containing the greater proportion of the carbonate is evaporated to
dryness, and calcined in a reverberatory furnace. The dry residue
constitutes the “blue salt” or “blue potash,” and contains from 70 to 80
per cent. carbonate of potash. It may be employed instead of pearlash,
or mixed with it, for the next batch of yellow prussiate. The
composition and amount of the insoluble residue left on lixiviation of
the “metal” vary according to the proportions and character of the raw
materials used. Other conditions being equal, horn gives the lowest
percentage of insoluble matter on lixiviation.</p>

<p>The large proportions of potash and phosphates contained in the
insoluble residues render them well suited for use in the manufacture of
artificial manures. As already mentioned, when regarded from a
scientific or economical point of view, the yellow prussiate industry is
carried on under very imperfect conditions. In addition to the amount of
potash, there is a very considerable waste of nitrogen, firstly, because
the larger proportion of that element present in the animal substances
is not converted into cyanogen at all, but passes off chiefly in the
form of ammonia salts; and, secondly, because part of the potassium
cyanide which is actually produced is lost by decomposition, and another
portion is left in the mother liquor. It has been calculated that out of
every 100 parts of ferrocyanide which should theoretically be obtained,
4 parts are lost when fairly pure materials have been employed, and 14
in the case of impure ingredients.</p>

samples of insoluble residue:&mdash;</p>

<p>As is well known, human excreta contain a considerable proportion of
nitrogen, and there seems no reason why this should not be employed in
the manufacture of yellow prussiate. It is quite possible that municipal
bodies might find this a convenient and profitable plan of disposing of
a portion of the sewage with which they have to deal. It is obvious to
all persons who have given this subject much consideration, that the
nitrogen required in the manufacture of yellow prussiate of potash might
be obtained with comparative ease from the surrounding atmosphere.
Indeed, from a theoretical point of view this seems a charming process.
About fifty years ago the Society of Arts awarded Lewis Thompson a medal
in connection with this very process. Thompson ignited a mixture of 2
parts pearlash, 2 parts coke, and 1 part iron turnings in an open
crucible for a considerable time at a full red heat. The resulting black
mass was found to contain a large quantity of ferrocyanide, together
with excess of carbonate of potash, &amp;c. This process, or a similar one,
in which a current of air was passed over a mixture of charcoal and iron
saturated with carbonate of potash, was tried on a large scale for two
years at Bramwell’s works at Newcastle. About 1 ton of yellow prussiate
was made daily by this process; but it was not found to work profitably,
and was eventually abandoned, chiefly, it is said, owing to the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
amount of fuel required, and because the cylinders, whether of iron or
fireclay, were not able to stand for any length of time the intense heat
to which they were subjected.</p>

<p>The annexed illustrations, <a href="#fig_14">Figs. 14 to 17</a>, show the arrangement of a
prussiate of potash furnace at Sir E. Buckley’s works, at Clayton,
Manchester, which are well designed to prevent nuisance: A, iron pot; B,
fire-place; <i>a</i>, cover of pot; <i>b</i>, stirrer; <i>c</i>, hinged pipe conveying
vapours to the flues; <i>d</i>, flues surrounding the pot, and leading to the
chimney-shaft; <i>e</i>, chain to lift up cast-iron vapour hood.</p>

<p>Brunquell, a German manufacturer, has criticised the present method of
conducting operations, and proposes that it is necessary as far as
practicable to aid the secondary formation of cyanogen by ammonia and
incandescent charcoal, and to avoid loss of potash by using pure animal
substances, and preventing contact with the solid products of combustion
from the furnace. With this view he adopts a horizontal reverberatory
furnace, the hearth of which is a cast-iron tray about 4½ ft. long, 4
ft. wide, and 3½ in. deep. The crown of the furnace is built as flat as
possible, the working space is limited, and the charge is kept from
contamination by the fire. Such a furnace, despite certain drawbacks,
presents important advantages. Fuel is economised; the process is
hastened so that seven or eight charges can be dealt with in a day,
instead of only four; and the furnaces cost less and endure longer. The
charge consists of 220 lb. potash, of which two-thirds is from
evaporated mother-liquors, and one-third fresh; 44 lb. animal charcoal
from the carbonisation of substances poor in nitrogen; 140-150 lb. of
pure animal matters as dry as practicable; and 17½ lb. iron. The firing
is urged and the charge is stirred till all the potash is fused, when
the ash-pit is closed, and the damper turned on for charging half the
animal charcoal. The firing and stirring are again pushed on till the
proper consistency is attained, and potassium vapour begins to burn off.
In this state the mass is ready to receive the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="fig_14" id="fig_14"></a></p>

<p class="nind">substances, those rich in nitrogen being first added in small portions
at a time. Their effect is to render the mass hard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> dry, and difficult
of fusion, whereupon the remainder of the animal charcoal should be
promptly introduced. After thorough agitation, the working door is
closed for a short time, and the contents of the furnace are rapidly
discharged into a covered iron pan.</p>

<p>The character of the animal matters employed varies so much that it is
impossible to lay down hard and fast rules for the proportions of the
several ingredients, or the duration of the roasting. Nor is the value
of a raw material always in proportion to its richness in nitrogen,
because the poorer material may waste less potash, consume less fuel,
and require less labour. The addition of iron filings or turnings is
useful only in prolonging the life of the cast-iron crucibles.</p>

<p><i>Combination of the Cyanide and Iron Solutions.</i>&mdash;A great number of
recipes are in vogue for combining the two solutions of ferrocyanide and
an iron salt, both with reference to their proportions, and to the
addition of foreign matters of various kinds. These variations in the
formulæ give rise to distinct names for some kinds of Prussian blue,
which will be referred to below. The ordinary common Prussian blue has a
greenish tendency, and is chiefly made according to one or the other of
the following directions:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Mix a solution of 100 lb. yellow prussiate with a solution of 100
lb. green copperas (ferrous sulphate) and 18 lb. alum, to which 9 lb.
sulphuric acid has been added, and let the mixture stand for 2-3 hours,
or until the solid portion has completely settled out. Decant the clear
supernatant liquor, and well wash the precipitate with clean waters.
Finally throw it on a filter and subject it to repeated disturbance, so
as to ensure the admission of air to every particle, in order that the
requisite oxidation may take place. The proportion of alum used is
subject to very great variation according to individual fancy; it
renders the subsequent grinding of the pigment a very much easier
matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> but it causes the shade of blue to be paler than it otherwise
would be.</p>

<p>(2) The simple solutions of green copperas and yellow prussiate in equal
proportions are mixed together without any other ingredient being added,
and the precipitate produced is washed, filtered, and aërated as in (1).
It is, however, inferior by reason of the oxide of iron formed in the
pigment spoiling the purity of the colour, and necessitating the
treatment of the wet mass with hydrochloric acid, at some expense, for
removal of the iron oxide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antwerp Blue.</span>&mdash;This pale variety of Prussian blue has but little
importance now. It is prepared by adding a solution of 4 lb. yellow
prussiate in 5-6 gallons of water to one of 2 lb. sulphate of iron, and
1 lb. each of alum and sulphate of zinc in an equal quantity of water.
The resulting pigment consists of a mixture of the ferrocyanides of
iron, alumina, and zinc; it is washed, filtered, aërated, and dried as
other forms of Prussian blue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bong’s Blue.</span>&mdash;When cyanide of potassium is added to an acid solution of
a copper salt, a red colour is produced, which has already been
mentioned by different observers. The substance formed is very
changeable, at least in the liquid where it is formed. It is decomposed
by acids, alkalies, cyanide of potassium, and even decomposes
spontaneously, the colour changing to yellow. It is precipitated by
insoluble cyanides; hence when a dilute acid is added to the red
solution, the dye is at once thrown down along with the cyanide of
copper. If the precipitate thus obtained is treated with sulphuretted
hydrogen, it is decomposed and the substance is set free. This substance
can combine with iron, like cyanogen, so as to conceal the properties of
the iron. This compound is very permanent, and has lately been studied
by Bong, who gives the following directions for its preparation:&mdash;</p>

<p>Cyanide of potassium is added in excess to an acid solution of a copper
salt until the red colour at first formed has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> disappeared, when a
ferric salt is at once added. On the addition of the iron salt, of
course, a copious precipitation of Prussian blue takes place, and the
liquid again turns to a dark purple-red. To separate the colouring
substance from the alkaline salts in the liquid, a dilute acid is added,
which precipitates it and the cyanide of copper. This precipitate is
combined with the Prussian blue, which also contains a considerable
quantity of the colouring substance, and then treated with a boiling
solution of carbonate of ammonia, in which it dissolves. As the cyanide
of copper also goes into solution, it is separated by again
precipitating it with an acid, and treating the precipitate with
sulphuretted hydrogen. The colouring substance thus liberated now
contains a certain amount of hydroferrocyanic acid, which is removed
after neutralisation by acetate of lead. It is now filtered, and the
purification is completed by precipitating with a silver salt and
treating the precipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen.</p>

<p>This purple-coloured compound crystallises very indistinctly. To
determine its composition, Bong precipitated it with acetate of copper.
When dried at 212° F., the rose-coloured precipitate had the following
composition: Carbon 24·31, nitrogen 28·04, hydrogen 1·88, iron 13·66,
copper 17·67, oxygen 14·44. Total 100·00. These numbers correspond to
the formula Cu, Fe Cy<sub>4</sub> (HO)<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>This substance is likewise precipitated by salts of zinc, mercury, and
silver. All these precipitates are pink or purple, very beautiful, and
of remarkable brilliancy. They are soluble in alkalies. Iron salts yield
no precipitate, nor do lead salts, except in the presence of ammonia,
when a blue-violet precipitate is formed. When treated with sulphuretted
hydrogen, these precipitates yield purple-red and acid liquids, which
undergo change in the air, especially if warm, forming Prussian blue.
When these liquids are neutralised with alkali, purple compounds are
formed, which are permanent in the air, soluble in water, slightly so in
alcohol, and insoluble in ether. Their colouring power is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> exceptionally
great. These pigments will unite with ferrocyanides, and in its
preparation such a compound is produced in considerable quantity; it is
likewise of a purple colour, and gives a rose-coloured precipitate with
acetate of lead. Both alone and in this compound it is very permanent;
it resists the action of sulphurous acid, concentrated and boiling
alkalies, and dilute acids, but is rapidly destroyed by chlorine and
nitric acid. If this pigment could be prepared cheaply enough, it would
probably be used with advantage in the arts, on account of its
resistance to chemical reagents and light, the variety of its shades,
and its brilliancy. It does not colour fibres directly, but can readily
be fixed on them from slightly acid solutions, if they are previously
mordanted with metallic oxides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brunswick Blue.</span>&mdash;This pigment is made in pale, medium, and deep shades,
and is an extremely useful colour, being very fine, requiring no
grinding, thoroughly permanent in light and air, hardly acted upon by
acids, but turned brown by alkalies, and liable on standing to separate
into two portions&mdash;a white and a blue&mdash;the latter coming to the surface
while the former sinks, and necessitating a thorough stirring of the
paint before use.</p>

<p>It generally consists simply of barytes, or gypsum, or china clay,
coloured by a small percentage of Prussian blue, with or without the
addition of a lesser proportion of ultramarine. The barytes or other
base is very thoroughly agitated in water, while a solution of green
copperas and a solution of yellow prussiate are gradually added without
ceasing the agitation. When the incorporation of the ingredients has
been completely accomplished, the precipitate is settled, washed,

<p><span class="smcap">Chinese Blue.</span>&mdash;This well-known and favourite form of Prussian blue is
prepared with great care, and is usually sold in fine powder or little
cubes. Its composition is virtually identical with that of ordinary
Prussian blue, but it is more free from impurities, and shows a fine
bronze bloom or lustre on newly fractured surfaces. Being pure, it is
entirely dissolved by oxalic acid; and its composition is about 52 per
cent. oxide of iron, 43½ cyanogen, and 4½ water. In dyeing and
calico-printing it is extensively employed. Its tint varies from
greenish to violet, according to modifications in the method of
manufacture, the chief difference being that yellow prussiate gives a
greenish tone and red prussiate a violet.</p>

<p>The process of preparation is mainly as follows. In about 40 gallons of
cold water dissolve 1 cwt. of green copperas selecting it carefully for
freedom from insoluble oxide; add about 5 pints of sulphuric acid. This
liquor very rapidly undergoes oxidation, by which oxide of iron is
thrown down, and the solution is rendered unfit for making the best
quality pigment. Therefore it should be prepared only immediately before
it is used. In another vessel containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> about 40 gallons of cold
water, dissolve 1 cwt. of yellow prussiate (if a green shade is
desired), or of red prussiate (if a violet tint is wished for). Even
larger quantities of water may be used for the solutions, as the more
dilute they are the finer is the colour precipitated and the greater the
lustre on the surface of the finished pigment.</p>

<p>When the two solutions of yellow or red prussiate and acidified green
copperas are brought together, a bluish-white precipitate is thrown
down. This is allowed to completely separate itself, and then the clear
supernatant liquid is drawn off.</p>

<p>The next step is to thoroughly oxidise the precipitate. This cannot be
satisfactorily accomplished by utilising the oxygen of the atmosphere,
as is done in other cases, because that method entails the production of
a certain amount of oxide of iron, which prejudicially affects the
purity of colour of the finished article. Of the chemical oxidising
agents which are available, the most satisfactory in point of cost and
efficiency is chloride of lime (bleaching powder). For each cwt. of
green copperas, mix about 20 lb. of bleaching powder into a thin cream
with water, and add it, in small quantities at a time, to the
precipitate, constantly stirring so as to ensure the absorption of the
whole of the chlorine by the blue. Without the addition be made
gradually and under agitation, the chlorine will be generated more
quickly than it can be absorbed, entailing a waste of gas and a noxious
vapour to be breathed by the workmen. Sometimes the bleaching powder is
added at an earlier stage, viz. to the green copperas solution, and in
that case the blue assumes a violet tone.</p>

<p>After the addition of the bleaching powder solution to the bluish-white
precipitate, it is acidified with hydrochloric acid, which develops the
blue. When the whole has settled, the supernatant liquor is drawn off,
and the blue powder is well washed and strained on a filter, then placed
in pans and dried very gradually indeed in the dark, at a tempera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>ture
never exceeding 130° F. The slower the drying the better is the gloss of
the pigment. It is most essential that iron be excluded during the final
grinding operation, or it may cause ignition of the mass, and its
conversion into oxide of iron would speedily follow.</p>

<p>It has been proposed to treat the white precipitate (obtained in the
usual manner from green copperas and yellow prussiate) by the chlorine
contained in aqua regia (nitro-hydrochloric acid). The copperas,
however, must be as free as possible from basic sulphate (oxide), which
is ensured by keeping a little metallic iron in the acid solution of
copperas. It is also desirable to effect the precipitation with crude
prussiate, so as to avoid absorption of oxygen and premature development
of the blue colour. Habich considers that the mistake is generally made
of using too little copperas, and he has found that when 90 lb. of
copperas have been added to 100 lb. of yellow prussiate, a drop of iron
solution in the filtered liquor produces no precipitate, while the white
precipitate has carried with it a certain proportion of prussiate, which
can be washed out. He therefore proposes to avoid this waste by pouring
the copperas solution into the prussiate solution, with constant
agitation, till no further precipitate goes down, then adding one volume
of the copperas solution equal to one-ninth of that already used. After
fifteen minutes stirring, it is certain that all the prussiate carried
down is decomposed.</p>

<p>The drained precipitate is blued (peroxidised) by adding aqua regia
prepared several days previously, and in proportions depending on the
strengths of the two acids. Generally, the aqua regia mixture will be
100 lb. of commercial nitric acid at 30° B. (containing 35·4 lb. of
anhydrous acid) and 62·2 lb. commercial hydrochloric acid at 23° B.
(containing 23·9 lb. of the anhydrous acid); and 40 lb. of this mixture
will suffice for bluing the precipitate resulting from 100 lb. yellow
prussiate. The addition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> the aqua regia should take place in a wooden
vessel with constant agitation.</p>

<p>According to another modification, the white precipitate obtained in the
usual way is blued by adding a solution of perchloride of iron, which
may be made from a hematite ore free from clay and carbonate of lime, or
from rouge. The iron oxide, from whatever source, is ground to a very
fine state, and treated with crude hydrochloric acid in a lead-lined
tank, where the mixture remains for several days, and is constantly
stirred. When saturated with iron the clear liquid is withdrawn for use.
To receive it, the white precipitate is rapidly heated to boiling in a
copper vessel, and is then transferred to a wooden vat, and the iron
perchloride solution is stirred in till the desired tint is produced.
The pigment is washed and dried in the ordinary way, while the
supernatant liquor (essentially protochloride of iron) is poured over
old scrap iron and used instead of copperas for a fresh batch of yellow
prussiate.</p>

<p>A solution of perchloride of manganese may be used instead of
perchloride of iron. Inferior qualities of manganese ore can be
employed, and the residues left after treatment with hydrochloric acid
may be washed and dried for sale as purified or peroxidised manganese.</p>

Colourless or brownish patches may occur, and must be removed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxon Blue.</span>&mdash;Following is a recipe for the preparation of this pigment,
which possesses limited importance.</p>

<p>Dissolve 8 lb. alum and 1 lb. green copperas in 16 gallons of water. Add
separate solutions of pearlash and yellow prussiate till precipitate
ceases to go down. Collect the precipitate when it has completely
settled; wash thoroughly, and dry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soluble Blue.</span>&mdash;This term is applied to a variety of Prussian blue which,
while possessing no difference in the matter of chemical composition,
yet has the distinctive feature of being soluble in water, which the
other varieties are not. It no longer enjoys the popularity it once had
as a dye, on account of the severe competition of the coal-tar colours.
Below are some of the most satisfactory formulæ for its preparation.</p>

<p>(1) Mix 10 lb. of Prussian blue thoroughly in about 10 gallons of cold
water. Then add 5 lb. of yellow prussiate and let the whole mass boil
steadily for several hours. Strain off the liquor and well wash the
precipitate on a filter. Finally dry for use.</p>

<p>(2) Dissolve about 1 cwt. of red prussiate in water and make the
solution hot. Prepare another solution of about 73 lb. of green copperas
in hot water. Mix the two solutions together and boil them for about a
couple of hours. Allow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> solid matters to settle out, then put them
on a filter and wash with clean water until a blue coloration manifests
itself in the drainings. The blue residue is then dried as usual.</p>

<p>(3) Make one solution of 10 lb. of yellow prussiate, and another of 8
lb. of green copperas, water being the solvent in both cases. Mix these
two solutions together and give them an hour’s boiling.</p>

<p>Add 3 lb. of a mixture of nitro-sulphuric acid, containing 2 parts of
the former to 1 of the latter. Boil for another hour. Let the solid
pigment precipitate itself thoroughly, and then filter, wash, and dry as
in the other cases.</p>

<p>(4) Dissolve about 1 cwt. of perchloride of iron and 10 lb. of sulphate
of soda in water. Also dissolve in another vessel 2 cwt. of yellow
prussiate and 10 lb. of sulphate of soda. Pour the first solution into
the second (never the contrary) and take care that the prussiate
solution is always preponderant. The Glauber’s salt is useful in
rendering the precipitation of the blue pigment more complete by reason
of the insolubility of the latter in saline fluids. When the blue
sediment is all thrown down it is drained off on a filter, and
repeatedly washed till a blue tint appears in the wash-waters, when it
is dried for use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turnbull’s Blue.</span>&mdash;This is an old-fashioned name often applied, like the
term Paris blue, to the violet shades of Prussian blue which have been
prepared with red prussiate.</p>

<p><b>Ultramarine.</b>&mdash;According to Rowland Williams, F.C.S., natural ultramarine
is, perhaps, the most beautiful blue pigment known. It was formerly, and
is now to a small extent, manufactured (chiefly for artists’ use) from
lapis lazuli, a blue mineral which occurs, intermixed with limestone and
iron pyrites, in Siberia, Thibet, and China. In order to obtain
ultramarine from lapis lazuli, the roughly pulverised mineral is
ignited, dipped into vinegar to remove carbonate of lime, and then
reduced to the finest possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> state of division. The powder is next
mixed with a cement composed of rosin, linseed oil, white wax, and
Burgundy pitch, and the resultant paste is worked under water until all
the ultramarine is separated. The ultramarine is washed several times
with water, and afterwards with alcohol, which removes any of the
resinous compound which may have adhered. When treated in this manner,
lapis lazuli yields from 2 to 3 per cent. of ultramarine. According to
Clement and Desormes, lapis lazuli has the following composition:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary=""

</table>

<p class="nind">It will be seen, therefore, that ultramarine essentially consists of
alumina, silica, soda, and sulphur, and may be regarded as a sodium
aluminium sulphate, in combination either with polysulphide of sodium
alone, or with a polysulphide and a polythionate of sodium. Clement and
Desormes believe that the iron in lazulite (lapis lazuli) is an
accidental impurity, and is neither essential to the mineral itself nor
to the ultramarine derived from it. There is still some doubt on this
point, however, many eminent chemists holding the opinion that iron is a
necessary constituent of ultramarine blue.</p>

<p>Natural ultramarine has been almost entirely replaced by the artificial
product, since methods have been devised for the manufacture of the
latter on a large scale. The possibility of preparing artificial
ultramarine suggested itself in a curious manner. About seventy years
ago a French alkali maker noticed the occasional appearance of a blue
coloured substance in his soda furnace. On analysis, Vauquelin found the
substance to have the same chemical compo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>sition as lapis lazuli, and
this incident led him to believe that ultramarine might be built up from
its elements. Several years passed away before Guimet succeeded in
manufacturing artificial ultramarine on anything like a large scale, but
Gmelin is said to have prepared it in small quantity half a dozen years
previously. There are four varieties of artificial ultramarine: (1) the
pure deep blue, equal in colour to average native ultramarine; (2) pale
blue; (3) violet or pink ultramarine; (4) green ultramarine. The latter
is obtained in the first stage of the ultramarine manufacture, being the
result of incomplete ignition of the materials employed. Ultramarine is
generally manufactured by one of the following processes:&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
“Sulphate”; (<i>b</i>) “Soda”; (<i>c</i>) “Silica.”</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “<i>Sulphate</i>” <i>Ultramarine</i>.&mdash;This may be prepared from sulphate of
soda (Glauber’s salt), charcoal, and kaolin (china clay). The materials
should be as free as possible from iron, and it has been found that clay
having approximately the formula Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> gives the
best results. The clay and sulphate of soda must be thoroughly calcined.
They are then intimately mixed with charcoal in the following
proportions:&mdash;</p>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class="rtbt">100·0</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="nind">Sometimes a portion of the sulphate of soda is omitted, and some
carbonate of soda and sulphur added instead. The composition of the
mixture then becomes:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary=""
 class="sz90">

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">Caustic soda is also sometimes used instead of carbonate. These mixtures
(whether sulphate alone or sulphate and carbonate) are made with a view
to have the soda present in sufficient amount to combine with one-half
the silica contained in the clay, and to leave sufficient soda to form
polysulphide of sodium with a portion of the sulphur. There should then
remain enough soda and sulphur to produce ordinary sulphide of sodium
(Na<sub>2</sub>S). If either of the two mixtures be ignited out of contact with
air, a white compound is formed, which is sometimes termed white
ultramarine. On leaving this exposed to the atmosphere for some time it
becomes green, and on further ignition, with free access of air, it is
converted into ultramarine blue. In actual working the carefully
prepared mixture of the above mentioned materials is heated for several
hours to a high temperature in fire-clay crucibles, only a limited
supply of air being allowed to enter, and the temperature being
eventually raised to a white heat. The product of this operation, when
cool, has a grey or yellowish-green appearance. It is washed several
times with water, dried, reduced to a fine powder, and then represents
the green ultramarine of commerce. Stölzel found that green ultramarine
had the following composition:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary=""

<p class="nind">Green ultramarine is transformed into blue by heating with about 4 per
cent. of sulphur at a low temperature, with free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> access of air. Sulphur
is afterwards added, if necessary, in small quantities at a time, and
the heating is continued until the desired shade of blue is obtained.
The mass is then powdered, the soluble matter (sulphide of soda, &amp;c.) is
removed by washing with water, and the blue is dried and assorted
according to quality.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “<i>Soda</i>” <i>Ultramarine</i> is sometimes made with soda alone (either
carbonate or caustic), and at others with a mixture of soda and sulphate
of soda. Rowland Williams found the following proportions of the
respective ingredients to answer satisfactorily:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary=""
 class="sz90"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class="rt">Per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>China clay</td><td class="rt">36·8</td></tr>

<tr><td>Sulphur</td><td class="rt">22·0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Coal</td><td class="rt">4·4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class="rtbt">100·0</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="nind">The proportions for soda and sulphate of soda ultramarine have been
previously given under “sulphate ultramarine.” The ignition is carried
on in a manner similar to that already described. The resultant green
product, owing to its avidity for oxygen, is partially changed into
ultramarine blue by simple contact with the air. It is entirely
converted into the blue variety by roasting with an additional quantity
of sulphur. With care, ultramarine blue may be manufactured in one
operation, by increasing the proportions of soda and sulphur.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) “<i>Silica</i>” <i>Ultramarine</i> is manufactured in the same way as soda
ultramarine, except that, in addition to the other materials, silica to
the extent of 5 or 10 per cent. of the weight of clay is employed. By
this process, ultramarine blue of a slightly reddish tint is obtained in
one operation. The method has, however, one decided drawback, viz. that
the materials employed are rather liable to fuse during ignition. The
faintly reddish hue of “silica” ultramarine becomes more intense
according to the proportion of silica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> present. “Silica” ultramarine is
said by some to be less readily attacked by acids and by strong alum
solutions than ultramarine prepared by the “sulphate” and “soda”
processes; but Rowland Williams’ experience does not confirm this
statement. He mentions that good artificial ultramarine withstands the
action of weak acids much better than is generally imagined. He had
occasion to test many samples which resisted the action of dilute acids
to a remarkable degree. Most strong acids, of course, decompose both
artificial and native ultramarine, with evolution of sulphuretted
hydrogen. Native ultramarine is, however, less susceptible to the
influence of acids (both strong and dilute) than the artificial
compound. This difference of behaviour is probably due to the fact that
the former contains considerably less sulphur than the latter, and it is
also possible that the constituents of natural ultramarine may be
combined in a somewhat different manner from those of the artificial
product.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the large amount of research with reference to the
chemical composition of ultramarine, the origin of its blue colour still
remains in doubt. According to Wilkens (<i>Ann. Ch. Pharm.</i>, xcix. 21),
ultramarine consists of two portions, one of which is easily attacked by
hydrochloric acid, and is regarded by him as the essential constituent,
whilst the other portion is insoluble in hydrochloric acid, and contains
variable proportions of clay, sand, oxide of iron, and sulphuric acid.
From his analyses of the pure blue, Wilkens deduces the formula
(2Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 3SiO<sub>2</sub>) (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 4SiO<sub>2</sub>) Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
3Na<sub>2</sub>S:&mdash;</p>

<p class="nind">Wilkens regards the blue colouring principle of ultramarine as a
compound of hyposulphite and sulphide of sodium. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> considers the
presence of iron is not necessary for the production of the blue; whilst
Dr. Elsner, in a paper published in 1841, states that about 1 per cent.
of iron (which he presumes to be in the state of sulphide) is essential.
Rowland Williams asks whether it is not conceivable that the blue colour
of ultramarine may be due to the presence of a small quantity of black
sulphide of iron, most intimately combined with a colourless or
comparatively colourless compound (such as white ultramarine), the whole
mass (owing to the dilution of the black sulphide) showing a blue
reflection.</p>

<p>Ultramarine is insoluble without decomposition in any known menstruum.
According to P. Ebell (Ber. 16), ultramarine, when in the most finely
divided state, will remain suspended in pure water for months. The
liquid may be filtered unchanged through several layers of Swedish
filter paper, and appears perfectly clear when examined in a ¾ in.
layer, and on evaporation deposits the ultramarine as a lustrous coating
on the sides of the vessel. Rowland Williams repeated the above
experiment, and can confirm Ebell’s statement. This result shows the
necessity of due precautions being taken during the washing of the
ultramarine in the process of manufacture, otherwise a considerable
amount of the finely divided blue may be lost. Ultramarine is largely
used in calico printing for pigment styles, being fixed on the fibre by
means of albumen. It is also employed for blueing linen and cotton, wax
candles, lump sugar, &amp;c. Ultramarine is not adulterated to a large
extent, the chief sophistication being barium sulphate (barytes), and
occasionally chalk and china clay.&mdash;(Rowland Williams, in <i>Industries</i>.)</p>

<p>Another writer in <i>Industries</i> says that the manufacture of ultramarine
has perhaps hardly received the attention it deserves in England. The
importance of the industry has been recognised in Germany, however, and
though the palmy days of the trade, when the whole production was in the
hands of a few firms, and the price was a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> private friendly
arrangement, are gone for ever, yet the business is in a flourishing
state, and should prove lucrative if properly managed. It is a
characteristically English failing to overlook branches of business not
dealing with large quantities of staple commodities, and thus many of
the smaller but remunerative industries have passed out of our hands.
When one observes that almost every sheet of ordinary blue official
paper is decolorised when accidentally brought into contact with an
acid, betraying the fact at once that its colouring matter is
ultramarine, one realises that a very considerable consumption for this
and similar purposes must take place. Like most trades based upon
chemical principles, the manufacture of ultramarine has recently made
rapid strides, and some of the latest developments are recorded in a
paper by J. Wunder, appearing in a recent number of the <i>Chemiker
Zeitung</i>, which is worthy of some attention.</p>

<p>With most people not directly interested in it, the term ultramarine is
taken to mean the <i>blue</i> pigment known under that name, the words being
reckoned almost synonymous. Others, more erudite, recognise the
existence of a green variety, but that the production of such colours as
red and violet is possible is scarcely suspected. Of course the blue is
the most important, but even that does not correspond to one specific
substance, products of different shade being prepared by modifying the
process of manufacture. As usually made, ultramarine is formed by
heating together carbonate of soda, kaolin, sulphur, and charcoal, with
limited access of air, the resulting pigment being green; this, on
roasting with sulphur, becomes blue. If the operation be conducted with
complete exclusion of air, so-called ultramarine white (in reality
<i>grey</i>) is produced, which becomes green on further heating. Ultramarine
blue capable of resisting the action of alum is sometimes required, and
may be obtained by the use of a highly silicious charge and much
sulphur, the burning being conducted in crucibles or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> in mass according
to the purpose for which the pigment is required. The former process is
costly, while the latter gives a product containing a good deal of free
sulphur, which is objectionable for such purposes as calico printing.
Removal of the excess of sulphur by heat or caustic soda is not
feasible, as the colour suffers in either case, but a certain amount of
success has attended experiments with sodium sulphide, the colour often
brightening noticeably.</p>

<p>It is curious that chemically pure sodium carbonate, or such as is made
by the ammonia-soda process, is not well fitted for the manufacture of
ultramarine; Leblanc soda, containing a little caustic, is distinctly
preferable. Sprinkling the soda with a strong solution of sodium
sulphide before use is a good plan, and one easy to adopt. The more
silicious the mixture the more difficulties are encountered, but the
product is a deeper, richer colour, and withstands the action of alum
and weak acids better. Excess of oxygen must be guarded against; many a
manufacturer has had a batch turn out a hard cold blue, instead of a
soft rich colour, solely on account of a too-excellent draught, an
accident especially liable to happen in winter time. So much dreaded is
this catastrophe that some makers habitually limit the air
supply&mdash;smothering the neighbourhood with smoke, and wasting coal. The
need for exact control here indicated points to a probable advantage
from the use of gaseous fuel. Considerable economy has resulted from the
use of the waste gases from one furnace serving for the preliminary
heating of another; a better plan would probably be the introduction of
regenerative heating.</p>

<p>The crude ultramarine as it comes from the furnace contains a large
proportion of soluble salts, notably 20 to 24 per cent. of sodium
sulphate, which have to be removed before it is merchantable. Usually,
after grinding, it is simply stirred up repeatedly with hot water and
the aqueous extract is siphoned off. That such a crude method should be
in vogue at the present time is very significant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> the ample margin of
profit that must exist. By systematic extraction and filtration under
pressure the washing may be effected with so little water that the
solution is sufficiently concentrated to pay for evaporation by the heat
of waste furnace gases, the recovered sodium sulphate serving to replace
part of the raw material.</p>

<p>The quality of ultramarine largely depending upon its fineness, it is
graded by levigation, the coarser portions being filter pressed, and the
finest “floating” quality, which remains in suspension for an
inconveniently long time, precipitated by the addition of a trace of an
ammonium salt, gypsum, or even hard water, and filtered by the aid of a
suction tube on the principle of an ordinary Bunsen pump.</p>

<p>The first successful attempt to produce ultramarine <i>violet</i> was made by
Professor Leykauf in 1859. By heating ordinary ultramarine with calcium
chloride in the presence of air and moisture, he obtained a violet-toned
pigment, but it was not a full colour. The active substance in this
change was probably hydrochloric acid, produced by the decomposition of
the calcium chloride. Later experiments with other reagents, such as
chlorine and gaseous hydrochloric acid, led to the following methods
being devised. In the first, ultramarine blue is spread out on stoneware
shelves in iron chambers and treated with a mixture of chlorine and
steam at a temperature of 300° F. to 480° F. for about three hours. In
the second, the plant is very similar, but at the bottom of the chambers
are stoneware dishes, into which hydrochloric acid is poured from time
to time. As the temperature is raised, copious vapours arise from these,
evaporation being aided by a strong draught, and the ultramarine blue,
after being kept at 428°-446° F. for some seven hours, becomes converted
into a dull violet, which brightens on continuing the process with a
temperature gradually falling to 320° F. The ultramarine violet produced
by either of the above methods resists the action of lime, and is of
general applicability.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The pigment produced by a third and simpler process, consisting merely
in heating ultramarine blue mixed with salammoniac and a little sodium
nitrate, is unfortunately not so stable. Another shade of considerable
interest is a pure bright light blue, formed by heating the violet
variety in hydrogen to about 536°-554° F. It has not yet been prepared
on a commercial scale, but certainly merits the attention of
manufacturers. An ultramarine red has been made by acting on the violet
produced by either of the first two methods with the vapour of either
nitric or hydrochloric acid at 275°-293° F., the sole essential
determining condition being the temperature. Iron vessels could be used
in the case of nitric acid at this temperature, but if hydrochloric acid
were employed stoneware would have to be substituted. In the manufacture
of the violet the temperature is above the limit at which hydrochloric
acid acts on iron.</p>

<p>It is now only necessary for some successful experimenter to put on the
market yellow and orange shades of ultramarine for almost the whole of
the spectrum to be represented. The problem of the cause of the colour
of ultramarine, attempts to solve which have been repeatedly made, seems
increasingly difficult when its protean character is considered; but
this from the industrial point of view is of secondary importance,
provided all required shades can be produced with ease and economy.
Nevertheless, it is certain that here, as in other cases, substantial
technical progress would follow from adequate scientific
investigation.&mdash;(<i>Industries.</i>)</p>

<p>Ultramarine was also made the subject of a very interesting paper, by
Herbert J. L. Rawlins, read before the Society of Chemical Industry, in
December 1887.</p>

<p>After referring to the native form, lapis lazuli, Rawlins goes on to
observe that “analysis could give no clue as to the cause of the blue
colour. To prepare it artificially became a great object, and the
efforts in this direction were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> stimulated by the offer of prizes,
amongst which was one of 6000 francs, offered by the ‘Société
d’Encouragement’ of France, to be awarded to the discoverer of a method
of making ultramarine, provided it did not cost more than 90<i>s.</i> per lb.
How strange it seems to think of this in these days when the value has
fallen to less than half that price per cwt.!</p>

<p>“As early as 1814, two German chemists, Tessärt and Kuhlmann, had
observed the formation of a blue product in soda kilns and calcination
kilns, but Guimet, in 1828, first discovered how it was produced, and
gained the 6000 francs prize. He did not, however, publish his method,
and grew immensely rich, although the price sank to about 16<i>s.</i> per lb.
In 1828 he was producing at the rate of 120,000 lb. annually.</p>

<p>“About the same time, or, as is positively asserted by some, even prior
to Guimet, Gmelin made the same discovery and published his researches
in full, thus perhaps laying the foundation stone of the present
supremacy of Germany in this manufacture.</p>

<p>“In spite of the valuable discoveries of Hoffmann, Unger, and others,
our knowledge of the chemical constitution of ultramarine is very
limited and uncertain, many different theories having been advanced
regarding the cause of the blue colour.</p>

<p>“According to Wilkins, ultramarine is composed of two portions, one of
which consists of two silicates of alumina with sulphite and sulphide of
sodium, and is constant in its composition; the other being a mixture of
variable quantities of sand, clay and oxide of iron, with sulphuric
acid. The blue colouring principle he considers to be a compound of
sodium sulphite and sulphide. Another ingenious theorist, Stein, in two
papers published in the <i>Jahresberichte</i> in 1871 and 1872, concludes
that blue ultramarine contains sulphurous, and not thiosulphuric acid,
that neither sulphites nor thiosulphates are necessary to its
composition, and that it owes its colour to the presence of black
sulphide of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> sodium, which is formed at high temperatures by the action
of sulphide of sodium on alumina&mdash;admitting, therefore, that it is not a
chemical compound, but merely a mechanical mixture, the blue colour of
which is due to the bodies composing it.</p>

<p>“Brunner considers ultramarine to be a compound of aluminium silicate,
with sodium sulphate and sulphide; while Brünlin regards it as a double
silicate of aluminium and sodium, in combination with pentasulphide of
sodium. Green ultramarine he considers to be the same double silicate in
combination with bisulphide of sodium.</p>

<p>“Again, according to Ritter, ultramarine contains a double silicate, not
only associated with polysulphide, but also with thiosulphate of soda;
and Schülzenberger, on the other hand, considers that it is a mixture of
a double silicate with sulphite and monosulphide of sodium.</p>

<p>“Endemann considers that the blue colour is due to a ‘colour nucleus,’
consisting of unchanging proportions of aluminium, sodium, oxygen and
sulphur, in each variety of ultramarine the proportion being different,
while the rest of the sodium and aluminium and the whole of the silica
merely act as a vehicle necessary to the preparation and existence of
the colour. He considers that this ‘colour nucleus,’ in the case of
white ultramarine, which he calls the ‘mother-substance in the
manufacture of blue ultramarine,’ has the formula AlNa<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>. By
the action on two molecules of this of sulphurous acid gas, Na<sub>2</sub>O is
removed, and green ultramarine Al<sub>2</sub>Na<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub> is formed, which
then, by the action of oxygen, which forms sodium sulphate, passes into
the pure green compound, having the formula Al<sub>2</sub>Na<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>S<sub>3</sub>. In
the ‘indirect process’ of manufacture, green ultramarine is converted
into blue by being burned with sulphur. By this means Endemann considers
that more sodium and sulphur are removed, and blue ultramarine
Al<sub>2</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>S<sub>3</sub> is formed. He considers that the other portion,
not included in the ‘colour nucleus,’ differs in different samples. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
one which he mentions it has about the composition
3Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.5Na<sub>2</sub>O.16SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>“But of all chemists who have worked on this subject, none has done more
to increase our knowledge of ‘the blue marvel of inorganic chemistry,’
as he himself has called it, than Reinhold Hoffmann. His position of
manager of the Marienberg Ultramarine Works, near Benscheim, in the
Grand Duchy of Hesse, renders his acquaintance with the manufacture
perfect, and his untiring researches on the subject have been well
rewarded by results both interesting and valuable. He considers
ultramarine to be a double silicate of sodium and aluminium, together
with bisulphide of sodium, the variety poor in silica, characterised by
its paleness and purity of tint, and easy decomposition by acids, having
the formula 4(Al<sub>2</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) + Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>; while that rich in
silica, characterised by its dark and somewhat reddish tint, and more
difficult decomposition by acids, has the formula
2(Al<sub>2</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>) + Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>. He also considers it very
doubtful whether green ultramarine is really a chemical compound, and
indeed it is now generally considered that the colour is only due to
small traces of sodium salts in very intimate mechanical mixture with
the blue variety, for by heating the green body for some time at 160°
with water in closed tubes, it is converted into the blue product, and
small traces of sodium compounds are found in solution in the water; and
further, on heating blue ultramarine strongly with sodium sulphate and
charcoal&mdash;that is, acting upon it with sodium sulphide&mdash;the green
variety is formed.</p>

<p>“In a paper by Knapp, an abstract of which appeared in the <i>Journal of
the Chemical Society</i> for March 1880, there are some curious facts
recorded with regard to the colouring agent. It was noticed that when
silicic acid was replaced by boracic acid, a blue, nearly as stable in
its properties as that of ordinary ultramarine, was produced. It was
found that a blue could be obtained without alumina being intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>duced.
Hence silica without alumina, and alumina without silica, can be
employed with a certain amount of success. The blue, however, formed
without silica, is not so strong or stable as that formed with it.</p>

<p>“One very curious property which ultramarine possesses is its power of
giving up its sodium in exchange for other metals. Thus, by heating blue
ultramarine with a concentrated solution of silver nitrate in sealed
tubes to 120° for fifteen hours, a dark yellow <i>silver</i> ultramarine is
produced, containing about 46·5 per cent. of silver. This corresponds to
about 15·5 per cent. of sodium, which is just about the amount that the
original body contained.</p>

<p>“When this body is heated with an aqueous solution of sodium chloride to
120° in sealed tubes, about three-quarters of the silver is replaced by
sodium, but the other quarter cannot be so replaced; in fact, blue
ultramarine, when heated with silver chloride, takes up silver, and
becomes green. But by heating silver ultramarine with sodium chloride in
the dry way, at rather a higher temperature, the whole of the silver is
replaced by sodium, but the ultramarine thus regenerated does not equal
the original body in colour. The change is probably due to the loss of
sulphur in the formation of the silver ultramarine.</p>

<p>“If in the above experiment potassium chloride be substituted for the
sodium salt, and the temperature not allowed to exceed 400°, a
bluish-green <i>potassium</i> ultramarine is formed. <i>Barium</i> ultramarine is
a yellowish-brown product, <i>zinc</i> ultramarine is violet, and <i>magnesium</i>
ultramarine is grey. These may all be obtained by acting on the yellow
silver ultramarine with the corresponding metallic chloride.</p>

<p>“From the experiments of Dollfus and Goppelsröder some very striking
differences have been brought to light between the three types of colour
which they examined&mdash;namely, the blue, green and violet&mdash;in their
behaviour with various reagents. Thus, an aqueous solution of caustic
soda or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> potash does not act on the blue or green, but turns the violet
to blue, and when heated with carbonic oxide the same result ensues.
Many other reagents have the same effect on the violet variety, but when
acted upon with sodium sulphide, the green turns grey, and when heated
with potassium chlorate becomes darker and loses its brightness of
colour. Dollfus and Goppelsröder attempt no explanation of these facts,
but simply state them as results of their observations, and profess
their inability to give any chemical formulæ for the three ultramarines,
though they consider that there is sufficient proof that each has its
distinct constitution. They give as their opinion, however, that they
are double silicates of aluminium and sodium, in which a part of the
oxygen is replaced by sulphur.</p>

<p>“Violet and red ultramarines are more bodies of scientific interest than
of any practical use, as their colouring power is not sufficiently
great. The violet variety may be prepared by exposing the underground
blue product to chlorine gas under a high temperature, while the red may
be obtained from the violet by acting on it, under a low temperature, by
dilute nitric acid fumes.</p>

<p>“The first artificial method of producing ultramarine was that known as
the ‘indirect process’&mdash;that is, first the manufacture of green
ultramarine; and secondly, its conversion into blue. It was carried out
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“An intimate mixture of Glauber’s salts, china clay, and coal or rosin,
finely ground together, was placed in crucibles and baked or burned in
an oven for about six hours. It was then transferred to iron trays, and
heated with flowers of sulphur to the point where the sulphur took fire,
when it was allowed to burn itself out. By this second process the green
was converted into blue. It was then washed, ground with water, and
settled out, the first deposit being of a darker shade than the second,
and the colour becoming lighter as the powder settled was finer in
grind. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> essentially the method employed now at many German
works&mdash;those at Marienberg, for instance&mdash;and produces what is known as
“sulphate ultramarine,” distinguished by its pale shade and almost
<i>greenish</i> blue tint.</p>

<p>“There are, however, some objections to the indirect process, and it was
considered advisable to find a plan by which ultramarine could be made
in bulk in a muffle furnace. The following is a method which is employed
at the present time in some of the German works:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A mixture of china clay, carbonate of soda, sulphate of soda, sulphur,
sand and charcoal or rosin, finely ground together, are placed upon the
floor of a muffle furnace, being pressed down so as to present an even
surface. The mixture is then entirely enclosed with fire-clay tiles, the
spaces between which are filled in with thin mortar. When the oven is so
charged, the front is built up, a small hole being left for watching the
temperature of the flue between the tiles and the top of the furnace,
and for drawing samples during the process, which is done through a
corresponding hole in the front of the fire-clay tiles, temporarily
closed with a fire-clay stopper. The oven is now heated, slowly at
first, and afterwards more strongly, so that at the end of eight or nine
hours it is at a dull red heat. It is kept at this temperature for about
24 hours, when the heat is raised so that a clear red glow is obtained,
which is kept up to the end of the operation.</p>

<p>“For the purpose of taking a sample, an iron spoon borer is introduced
through the hole left in the enclosing tiles, turned round, and pulled
out. The contents are laid on a clean tile, and quickly covered with
another tile, on which a second quantity is placed, and allowed to
remain exposed to the air. If the oven has been sufficiently heated the
covered sample should appear of a bluish green, and no longer brown or
yellow, while the second sample should be rather bluer. If this be the
case, the oven is heated slowly for another hour, and then all
communication with the outer air is cut off. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> is allowed to cool and
then opened, when the contents should appear as a beautiful blue mass,
the lower portion of which, however, is of a greenish tinge. Both parts
are now treated alike, but worked up separately, the greenish-blue
portion making an inferior article. The finishing process is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The raw ultramarine is ground in upright mills, and then repeatedly
boiled for about ten or fifteen minutes at a time in cast-iron boilers,
being all the time agitated by a mechanical stirring arrangement. It is
then allowed to settle, and the water is drawn off with a siphon. As
soon as the powder settles into a hard compact mass, it has been
sufficiently washed, and it is then dug out. The part next to the bottom
of the boiler is generally coarse and of poor quality. It is carefully
separated from the upper portion, which is transferred to wet mills of
the ordinary description, and there ground for six to twelve hours,
during which time about 150 lb. can be treated in each mill. The ground
colour from these mills is then collected in a large tub, and allowed to
settle for four hours, during which time the coarsest particles fall to
the bottom. The liquid is then passed through a series of tubs, in each
of which it is allowed to stand for a period of time, lengthening as the
quality settled out becomes finer, the last settling requiring about
three weeks. The various qualities are then dried and sifted, when they
are ready for the market.</p>

<p>“The blue produced by this operation is of a good quality, but there are
some objections to the process, which have given rise to another, in
which the ultramarine is produced direct in crucibles similar to those
used in the indirect process.</p>

<p>“This is conducted as follows:&mdash;The mixture of raw materials consists of
about 100 parts of china clay, 90 of carbonate of soda, 110 of sulphur,
20 of charcoal, and a quantity of infusorial earth, varying according as
the ultramarine produced is desired to be rich or poor in silica.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> These
are finely ground together, in which process great care must be
observed, as much depends upon its being properly carried out. The
mixture is then filled loosely into crucibles provided with flat
circular lids, which are fixed on with mortar containing clay. This is
allowed to dry, and the crucibles are then ready for firing, which
process is conducted in ovens, generally constructed so as to contain
several hundred crucibles, which are arranged in rows one above another.</p>

<p>“The mixture undergoes a very curious change of colour while in the
ovens. When put in it is greyish white, and during the process of
burning it becomes successively brown, green, blue, violet, red and
white, in the order named. These changes are, according to Guimet, due
to oxidation. The brown appears with the blue flames due to the
combustion of the sulphur, the green just after the sulphur flames have
ceased, and the blue is first formed at a temperature of about 700°&mdash;i.
e. a bright red heat. If, after this, heat be still applied and air
freely admitted, the mixture becomes first violet, then red or rose
coloured, and finally white. When this white body is heated to redness
with carbon or other reducing agents, the red, violet, blue, green and
brown colours (according to the amount of reducing agent employed) may
sometimes be reproduced, though the reaction is by no means a certain
one.</p>

<p>“If brown ultramarine be removed from the oven, and allowed to remain
exposed to the air, it immediately takes fire and burns to an inferior
blue colour. The same thing occurs with the green body. Even if the
brown product be completely cooled before being exposed to the air, it
will, as soon as the air is allowed to reach it, get hotter and hotter,
until it is glowing, when it will burst into flame and become blue.
Attempts have been made to preserve the brown colour, which is of a
beautiful chocolate tint, but have always failed. In one instance, when
this was tried, the colour was put immediately into water, and treated
like the ordinary blue variety, and as long as it was kept moist no
change was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> apparent. After being washed and wet ground the moist powder
was put into a cask, where for some time it was allowed to remain
undisturbed. At the end of about three weeks it was noticed that the
mass was hot, and on being turned out of the cask and broken up it was
found to be at a glowing heat in the interior.</p>

<p>“After the oven has been fired for several hours, it is carefully closed
at every point where air might enter, and allowed to cool for four or
five days. The exact length of time during which the ovens are fired,
and the amount of air admitted, depend upon various circumstances, one
important one being the state of the weather. Thus, on a dull, foggy
day, when the draught in the chimney is not good, a longer time is
required. Of course, no rule can be given for this, and it is the
experience required in the management of the oven that makes the
manufacture so difficult to carry out successfully, the early efforts of
a manufacturer not unfrequently resulting in the loss of a whole ovenful
of raw material. As soon as the oven has cooled, the crucibles are taken
out, and the contents of each are turned out in a solid mass, which must
be carefully cleaned with a knife of any badly burned portions, and
afterwards broken up and thrown into a cask along with the contents of
other crucibles.</p>

<p>“This forms what is known as crude raw ultramarine. It contains about 15
per cent. of sulphate of soda, which must be removed before the colour
is fit for sale.</p>

<p>“For this purpose it is washed with hot water in large tubs, after which
it is ground in wet mills to an impalpable powder, and allowed to stand
for about an hour in a large tub, in order to remove the coarsest
particles and dirt which are sure to be present. It is then removed to
another tub, where it settles for four or five hours, and from this it
passes to others, where it stands for various lengths of time,
increasing, of course, as the powder to be settled becomes finer, the
last settling occupying three or four weeks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> producing the
strongest quality that can be obtained&mdash;that is to say, it will bear
mixing with more of a reducing medium, such as mineral white, than would
a former settling for the mixture in each case to be of the same depth
of colour.</p>

<p>“The water, after the final settling, still contains about 5 per cent.
of ultramarine. This would take five or six months to settle, and as
this time could not generally be given to it, it is precipitated with
lime water, which has a sort of coagulating influence upon the
particles, which can then be removed by filtration. It is a curious
thing that this last quality is quite different from the one preceding
it, being very inferior in both colour and strength.</p>

<p>“After settling, all the various qualities are dried in kilns, and
sifted through fine brass wire sieves by means of a fan, which breaks up
the lumps and forces the particles through the meshes of the sieve,
which must be very close&mdash;about 100 to the inch&mdash;in order that the
ultramarine may be perfectly smooth and free from lumps or grit of any
sort. When finished, it should be in the form of an impalpable
powder&mdash;the finer qualities so fine, indeed, as to feel almost <i>buttery</i>
when rubbed between the fingers. After this process the different
qualities and shades are mixed to certain standards, and are then ready
for sale.</p>

<p>“The uses of ultramarine in the arts and manufactures are very numerous
and important. The most important, from the point of view of quantity,
is the manufacture of ‘square blue’ for washing purposes. In the
preparation of this article the ultramarine is generally mixed with
bicarbonate of soda and some glutinous material, to help it to retain
its shape, and is then pressed into the well-known form of small square
or oblong blocks.</p>

<p>“It is also used largely in the manufacture of blue paint and printing
ink, and in the preparation of blue mottled soap. The way in which it is
employed in the last-named manufacture is worthy of remark. It is added
to the soap while it is in a molten state and just before it is allowed
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> cool, and thoroughly mixed with it, so that the whole mass is of a
pale blue tint. If a small quantity of this be removed from the boiler
and cooled quickly, it remains of a uniform tint, but in the case of the
whole boilerful, where the cooling is very slow, the action is entirely
different. Just at the point of cooling, when the soap is going to set
hard, the ultramarine&mdash;to use a technical expression&mdash;“strikes,” and
goes into the form which gives to blue mottled soap its well-known
appearance.</p>

<p>“In the manufacture of paper, ultramarine also plays an important part.
It is here used not only for producing blue shades, but also as a
bleaching agent, to counteract the yellow when white paper is made.</p>

<p>“Another important use is in the calico manufacture, where it is used
both in the printing of blue patterns and in the finishing of goods. In
the case of calico printing, it is mixed with albumen and printed on to
the calico, which is then subjected to the action of steam, the albumen
being by this means coagulated and each grain of ultramarine surrounded
by an insoluble envelope, so that it cannot be washed out of the calico.</p>

<p>“The growth in the manufacture of ultramarine has been very remarkable,
especially when it is considered how little the process is understood
chemically, and what care and patience&mdash;to say nothing of the equally
important item of capital&mdash;are required in the starting of a
manufactory. Commencing less than 50 years ago in the works of Guimet,
at Lyons, who produced 120,000 lb. annually, there are at the present
day nearly 40 manufactories at work in various parts of the
world&mdash;chiefly in Germany&mdash;producing about 20 million lb. per year. The
following figures will give some idea of ten years’ growth of this
industry&mdash;from 1862 to 1872:&mdash;</p>

<p>“From the above numbers it will be seen that in these ten years the
manufacture more than doubled itself, the fact being due, however, not
so much to the increase in the number of works, which was only
one-third, as to the enlarged capabilities of those existing in 1862.
Thus, in the works of Dr. Leverkus, near Cologne&mdash;the first works ever
started in Germany&mdash;the number of men employed had, during these ten
years, more than doubled, while the output had trebled; and in the case
of the Marienberg Works the difference was even more striking, the
number of hands employed and the quantity turned out per annum having
nearly quadrupled.”</p>

<p>In reply to various questions which were asked in the discussion which
ensued, Mr. Rawlins said that, with regard to the use of ammonia soda,
it had frequently been used in the manufacture of ultramarine, and was
constantly used he understood, but he himself had not much experience of
it. As far as he could make out, it certainly produced ultramarine, but
of a darker shade than that made with Leblanc soda. It could not be
supposed, in works where the Leblanc soda was used, that ammonia soda
could conveniently be substituted, for of course a works when
established had to adhere to its known standards and shades, and it
would not do to change the raw materials, though the ammonia soda
produced a very good ultramarine. As regards the discovery of
ultramarine, the first works started anywhere were Guimet’s. He had with
him a little historical list containing the dates at which the various
works established before 1866 or a little later had been started. It was
drawn out by Hoffmann, who, as he stated before, was the manager of
large ultramarine works, and he put down Guimet’s, which were started in
1829, first on the list. Dr. Leverkus started in 1834. He knew that the
discovery of ultramarine had been attributed to different people. He had
mentioned Guimet because it had generally been considered, as far as he
had heard, that Guimet and Gmelin were the two who discovered it from a
manufacturing point of view. He had heard of crystals of ultra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>marine,
but had never seen any, and he knew they were very difficult to prepare,
and very rare. He had mentioned that the grinding had to be done very
thoroughly, because the better it was mixed and the finer it was ground,
the better was the ultramarine produced. If it was badly mixed it was
quite fatal to getting a good result. Grinding lightens the colour. Raw
ultramarine must be ground before it was practicable to use it at all.
For instance, a coarse ultramarine could not be used for printing
calico. Therefore it was necessary to grind it both for the sake of the
colour and for the sake of the way in which it was applied. It was
increased in value by grinding because it made it stronger and finer.
Before grinding it was of a dark colour, but after grinding it became
lighter and brighter.</p>

<p>The materials employed in McIvor’s process for making ultramarine are
kaolin or other suitable clay, a solution of sulphide of sodium, in
which sulphur in the form of flowers of sulphur is dissolved to
saturation, and caustic or carbonate of soda.</p>

<p>The preparation of the solution is effected by adding the sulphur to
boiling sulphide of sodium liquor of maximum strength until it ceases to
be taken up. The clay and soda are first roasted together at a red heat,
so as to effect a partial double decomposition, and the product, after
grinding, is made into a thick paste with “sulphur liquor,” i. e. the
sulphide of sodium solution of sulphur. This latter operation may be
carried out in an ordinary pug-mill. The paste so formed is dried in an
oven or other convenient way, and the dried mass (being broken into
small pieces) is roasted without access of air in a closed earthenware
retort, first at about 480°-570° F. for an hour, then at a red heat for
eight hours, and finally at a moderate heat just below dull redness, in
presence of a slow current of air, which enters through a series of
holes or small openings in the front of the retort, the current being
regulated by means of a damper or an adjustable slide. The retort should
be allowed to become quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> cold before being opened, otherwise the tint
of the product will be injured.</p>

<p>McIvor has found the following proportions of the raw materials used in
the process to yield excellent results, viz:&mdash;</p>

<p>The following communication from the pen of J. B. Nejedly, of Vienna,
appeared in the <i>Chemiker Zeitung</i>, during 1888:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Animated by various articles and notes in your journal under the
heading of ‘The Present Position of the Manufacture of Ultramarine,’ I
would like to draw out of obscurity a little work on this industry which
contains much that is true, and furnishes at the same time many
comparisons with regard to the present position of the ultramarine
industry in Germany.</p>

<p>“The work above referred to was printed in the year 1840 and bears the
title:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p class="nind">“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Treatise on the chemico-technical preparation of Ultramarine
colours, according to the discoveries of Leykauf and Heyne, or on
the importance of the manufacture of blue and green Ultramarine for
purposes of science, art, and industry. By Friedr. Wilh. Heyne,
president of the Nürnberg Ultramarine Manufactory. Nürnberg: 1840.
Printed at the Campe Press.’</p></div>

<p>“The preface, which I consider to be well suited to present
circumstances, I reproduce verbatim, while from the little work itself I
will only quote such sentences as would seem to be suited to the present
time, and which are the most important as bearing on the subject.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span><i>Preface.</i>&mdash;The incitement to this treatise was furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> by the
utility of the discovery of Leykauf, instructor of chemistry at the
technical schools in Nürnberg, of artificially preparing the well-known
blue mineral colour styled ultramarine, according to simple principles,
which discovery was supplemented by the production of the green
ultramarine, an equally genuine and beautiful green mineral colour, by
the technist Heyne in Nürnberg. A short review of the importance of
these two discoveries for mankind in general and for science, art, and
industry in particular, will form the main subject of this treatise,
which has no other object but that of arousing the attention of all high
protectors and stimulators, as well as friends of industry and art, to a
newly-born industrial branch. At this moment we are living in a period
when many industries have got into the stocks, in consequence of far too
severe competition, combined with other influences; indeed they are
barely able to support those engaged in them. If in consequence of this
state of things it already becomes of the most vital importance that
fresh sources of acquisition should be obtained, it becomes all the more
so when by their means at the same time materials come into requisition
which the Fatherland possesses in great superfluity, and which otherwise
possess no intrinsic value beyond just the expense of extracting them
from their natural localities or deposits, and the worth that attaches
to their working up for industrial purpose. A source of acquisition in
this sense is met with in the manufacture of blue and green ultramarine
colours, which in course of time can be raised to an extremely valuable
acquisition. May the communications here made result in their being
considered worthy of a thorough many-sided investigation and
consideration.’</p>

<p class="c"><small>“REGARDING THE WORK ITSELF.</small></p>

<p>“Page 21.&mdash;‘Not long since a prize of 6000 francs was offered by the
“Société d’Encouragement.” This prize was gained by Guimet, who has not
published his process, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> who now furnishes ultramarine at the price
of 25 francs per oz., whereas it otherwise cost 200 francs per oz.
Latterly, in 1839, Guimet reduced his price for ultramarine, viz. No. 1,
for painting, to 10 francs, a lighter shade being 6 francs per oz. In
addition, this manufacturer furnishes lower qualities for carpet and
paper manufacturers at 20 francs and 12 francs per lb.’</p>

<p>“Page 23.&mdash;‘Indeed, if we are able to produce ultramarine by means of a
polysulphide of sodium and common clay, then the most beautiful and most
lasting of all known blue colours would at the same time become the
cheapest of them all.’</p>

<p>“Page 27.&mdash;‘All faults which are known to exist in the old methods are
obviated in the new invention of Leykauf and Heyne, while the same
offers the following advantages:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>(1) The materials which are treated with it can be brought into use
without any special previous chemical preparations, indeed as supplied
by Nature, while chemical treatment is entirely unnecessary. In view of
the unimportant cost of derivation of the raw material, there cannot
consequently be any questions raised with regard to waste.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>(2) This method is so simple that any man of sound intellect can
easily work it, without possessing any special chemical knowledge
beforehand. As the labour can be easily grappled with, errors can only
occur when the grossest carelessness is shown in conforming to the
instructions prescribed.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>(3) According to the said method one can work according to any desired
scale, and, what is best of all, the larger this scale the more
favourable are the results obtained, lighter work and excellence of
quality.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>(4) If the process is carefully conducted, everything is in your own
power, nothing depending on chance.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>(5) Consequently an equal product can invariably be obtained, while
this can at will be brought to the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> complete stage of perfection at
but little greater cost than lower qualities entail.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>(6) According to this method you are master of the fire, enabling a
retention of colours in any desired shade, of the deepest tone, of the
greatest permanency.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>From this it appears: That this process is the easiest, the cheapest,
and the most complete. Worked according to this method the hope is
likely soon to become a reality that ultramarine may yet become the
cheapest of all mineral colours, and as in the same everything rests
upon simplicity, the preparation of the article in future will be
carried on somewhat after the fashion of baking, brewing, &amp;c.’</p>

<p>“Page 32.&mdash;‘Moreover, there is not only blue ultramarine, but also a
pure green, and we may venture the hope that similar combinations in
white, black, red, and yellow will soon follow in equal perfection. In
consequence of these discoveries, Leykauf and Heyne have erected a
factory in Nürnberg, which, according to a circular dated 15th July,
1840, is in operation under the style of “Leykauf, Heyne and Co.,” and
are producing the two ultramarine colours referred to at the present
time at the rate of 50 lb. per day.’</p>

<p>“Page 33.&mdash;‘All the mechanical appliances of the factory are at the
present time exclusively worked by hand, the number of persons employed
being sixteen; while the establishment upon completion of the buildings
that are wanting is calculated to employ twenty operatives and two
horses. With this extension the factory will be able to turn out 5 cwt.
blue and 5 cwt. green weekly, consequently annually 500 cwt. of finished
merchantable ultramarine will be brought on the market.’</p>

<p>“Page 35.&mdash;‘Now, as regards the prices ruling at present for Nürnberg
ultramarine, these are, as compared with those of the French, more than
500 per cent. cheaper. Blue ultramarine costs, namely, in Nürnberg,
quality No. 0, 10 florins per lb.; a lighter quality, which is
nevertheless darker than the darkest French at 100 francs, 5 fl. per
lb.; a third quality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> likewise darker than the seconds French at 60
francs, 3 fl. per lb. Green ultramarine, 3 fl. 10 kr. per lb.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>How much further, however, these low prices will be yet reduced after
the completion of the factory, may be gathered from a detailed
calculation of cost which the chief of this factory has made himself
responsible for as being the highest estimate. This calculation of cost
is based upon the weekly production of 10 cwt., which the factory will
soon be able to turn out, and upon a necessary cost of plant and working
capital of 90,000 Rhenish florins, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ultramarine is by far the most commonly used of the blue pigments. It is
a chemical combination of silica, alumina, soda, and sulphur, but its
exact chemical constitution is not known, the proportions of its
ingredients varying somewhat with different makes. There are two
principal varieties of ultramarine sold. One is known as sulphate
ultramarine the other as soda ultramarine, from the materials used in
the process of manufacture. In the first, silica, china clay, <i>sulphate
of soda</i>, and coal are used; in the latter, silica, china clay,
<i>carbonate of soda</i>, and sulphur are used. The sulphate ultramarine is
distinguished by its very pale greenish blue colour, while the soda
ultramarine is of a violet hue.</p>

<p>Ultramarine is distinguished from other blues by the fact that acids
completely decolorise it, with the evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen
and the formation of a white precipitate of sulphate.</p>

<p>The sulphate ultramarine is more easily decomposed by acids than the
soda ultramarine, and some makes of the latter more easily than others.
Alkalies and heat have no action on this pigment. Boiled in strong
nitric acid, ultramarine is completely decolorised, a colourless
solution being formed, and a gelatinous mass of silica being left as a
residue.</p>

<p>It is not as a rule necessary to make an analysis of the pigment; the
above tests serve to distinguish it from other pigments.</p>

<p>An assay of ultramarine should include the following points:&mdash;1st,
colour or tint; 2nd, covering power or body; 3rd, acid resisting
properties: this can be tested by making a very weak solution of
sulphuric acid&mdash;about 4 oz. in 1000 oz. of water&mdash;and adding a little of
this to the pigment contained in a glass, and noting how long it takes
to bring about decolorisation; 4th, the power of resistance to the
action of alum. When ultramarines are boiled with a solution of alum,
they are more or less reddened thereby; those which are made with a
large excess of silica are found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> to resist this action of alum better
than those containing a normal quantity of this compound. Such
ultramarines are preferred by the paper maker, who uses a large quantity
of alum and sulphate of alumina in the sizing of his papers, and
therefore he wants an ultramarine which shall not change in shade when
used for tinting alumina sized papers. This point is easily tested. A
solution of alum is made, and in a little of this a small quantity of
ultramarine is boiled for a few minutes, and it is noted whether any
change of shade occurs. If any sample is found to change much, that
sample must be rejected for paper tinting, although it may be used by
the painter or the laundress.</p>

<p>It may be worth pointing out here that ultramarine should not be used
with any other colours which have a tendency to be acid, as sooner or
later the colour will be destroyed. It should also not be used with lead
or copper pigments, as the sulphur it contains tends to react on those
metals; forming the black sulphides, thus leading to the ultimate
discoloration of the mixture.&mdash;(<i>Chemical Trade Journal</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />
<b>BROWNS.</b></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Brown</span> colouring matters are obtained from all three kingdoms&mdash;the
animal, the vegetable, and the mineral&mdash;but in greatest abundance from
the last named. The natural mineral brown pigments afford almost every
variety of tint, and being largely composed of silica and metallic
oxides they are remarkably permanent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Asphalt or Bitumen.</span>&mdash;These names are applied to a variety of black or
brown resinous matters found in many parts of the world in a mineralised
state, though derived originally from organic sources. The “Bitumen of
Judæa” is supposed to be found on and around the Dead Sea, but the bulk
of the product going by that name really comes from Trinidad. All kinds
of asphalt have a pungent and peculiar smell, melt at a low temperature,
are very combustible, and while dissolving in turpentine, and more
readily in coal tar naphtha, are insoluble in water and in alcohol. Very
little asphalt is now used as a pigment, but it continues to find a
limited application in varnish making, notwithstanding the tendency of
varnishes containing it to suffer from minute cracks with the lapse of
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bistre.</span>&mdash;This pigment is used exclusively in water-colour painting, for
which purpose it affords a fine warm yellowish tinted brown. It is of
vegetable origin, being prepared from the soot which is deposited in the
flues leading from fireplaces which consume wood fuel. Every wood,
however, does not afford an equally good sample of bistre, and beech
occupies the foremost rank in this respect. The brightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> and blackest
soot is selected, and after careful grinding and sifting through a very
fine sieve, it is repeatedly stirred up, for several hours at a time, in
a series of clean hot waters, the object of which is to dissolve out all
traces of tarry and other soluble matters, which very seriously affect
its permanence, being oxidised on exposure to air and light, and thus
weakening the tint. The washing is therefore a matter of the very first
importance. The solid pigment is allowed to settle out of each wash
water, and is collected and dried, being mixed with a small proportion
of gum water to give cohesion. The drying is effected in a stove room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bone Brown.</span>&mdash;This unimportant pigment is simply underdone bone black
(see <a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>), and is obtained by stopping the calcination of the bones at
a point which falls short of thorough charring. In consequence it
contains a proportion of unaltered animal matters, which sooner or later
may undergo decomposition, and prejudicially affect the painting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cappagh Brown.</span>&mdash;A mineral pigment which is only a variety of umber, and
may best be described under that head (see <a href="#Page_105">p. 105</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassel Earth.</span>&mdash;Another name for Cologne earth, <i>q. v.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chicory Brown.</span>&mdash;This vegetable pigment is rich-coloured but lacks
permanence. It is prepared by calcining roots, such as those of chicory,
in vessels to which air is not admitted, from which then results a fine
brown powder. This is boiled in water, and the solution is evaporated to
dryness, yielding a brown pigment, which, being soluble in water, is
sometimes employed by water-colour artists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cologne Earth.</span>&mdash;This material, which is also known as Cassel earth or
Rubens brown, is an earthy carbonaceous substance, probably derived from
the decomposition of lignite or brown coal, readily undergoing
combustion without emitting flame or smoke. Large deposits of it are
worked in the vicinity of Cologne, whence its name. It is blackish-brown
in colour, smooth and crumbling to the touch, and very light. To remove
soluble impurities it is subjected to several washings in water, and
then collected, mixed with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> little gum-water, and dried in small
moulds. The colour is used by artists, but is very variable in
composition and uncertain in durability.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manganese Brown.</span>&mdash;One of the most durable brown pigments used by the
Romans is found to be oxide of manganese, which discovery has led to the
proposal to prepare the binoxide of that metal as a brown pigment. The
method suggested is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The protochloride of manganese, derived from the manufacture of
chlorine, or the protosulphate resulting from the calcination of the
protoxide with iron sulphate, is dissolved in warm water (85°-105° F.);
to this is added a sodium hypochlorite solution, or a solution of
potassium hypochlorite containing a small proportion of carbonate of
soda, the addition being continued until the precipitated manganese
binoxide ceases to change colour, marking the completion of the
oxidation. The supernatant clear liquor is drawn off, and the
precipitate is washed first with acidulated water (containing 2 per
cent. of sulphuric acid), and then with pure water till all trace of the
acid is removed. The dark-brown impalpable powder of manganese binoxide
is stove dried, and forms a permanent and safe pigment with good
covering power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mars Brown.</span>&mdash;One of the products obtained by the calcination of Mars
yellow (<i>q. v.</i>) at various temperatures and under different conditions
is a full-tinted and durable brown due to sesquioxide of iron. Another
method of preparing it is from alum, sulphate of iron, and chloride of
manganese. In either case the pigment is not superior to umber or oxide
of iron, while it cannot be produced as cheaply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prussian Brown.</span>&mdash;An artists’ colour known by this name is prepared from
Prussian blue, but as it has no superiority over Vandyke brown or umber,
and is higher priced, it is not in general use. It consists essentially
of carbon and ferric oxide, resembles bistre in tone, and possesses
durability and good covering powers. The operation of calcining the
Prussian blue should be conducted slowly, and is best performed in a
closed vessel, though it may also be done in the open.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> The pieces of
blue should not be larger than a hazel nut. They soon split, scale off,
and become red, when the heating should cease. On breaking the cooled
particles they will show a patchy coloration varying from
yellowish-brown to black. On grinding, the mass assumes the desired
brown hue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubens Brown.</span>&mdash;Another name for Cassel brown or Cologne earth (<i>q. v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sepia.</span>&mdash;This is one of the few pigments derived from the animal kingdom.
It is produced by several sea-inhabiting creatures belonging to the
class called <i>Cephalopoda</i>, and more particularly by two members of the
genus <i>Sepia</i>, known respectively as <i>Sepia officinalis</i> and <i>Sepia
loligo</i>. A peculiarity of these cephalopods is that they are provided
with what is commonly called an ink bag, in other words a gland or sac
filled with a blackish-brown liquid, which possesses intense colouring
power. The object of the secretion is the protection of the creature
from pursuit by its enemies, a portion of fluid being discharged at
will, and so obscuring the surrounding water that escape is facilitated.</p>

<p>For the sake of this pigment the cuttle-fish are sought after by
fishermen in the localities frequented by the animals, notably in the
warm waters of the Mediterranean. When the creatures are captured, their
glands are carefully extracted and sun-dried so as to solidify the
contents. In this state ink bags are sent into commerce. The colourman
subjects the sacs to boiling in a solution of soda or potash, whereby
the colour is dissolved out of the receptacle, and being filtered clear
of all fragments of the animal tissue, is next precipitated by the
addition of acid, collected on a filter, washed, and dried. It then
forms an exceedingly useful pigment, having, according to Prout, the
following average composition:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is remarkably permanent for an organic substance, suffering no
alteration on being combined with other pigments, and withstanding the
effects of exposure to air and light. Though slightly transparent, and
not quite constant in tint, it possesses very great colouring power.
Being of extremely fine texture it can be worked up equally well as an
oil colour or as a water colour, but it is especially in the latter
capacity that it forms an indispensable artists’ colour, and permits the
production of a great range of shades and tints.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ulmin.</span>&mdash;The pigments grouped under this name are also of organic origin;
but though they possess good colour, mix well, and flow readily from the
brush, they lack the durability which is essential to their successful
use. The following methods have been employed in their preparation:&mdash;(1)
Fused caustic potash is digested in alcohol, and the liquor filtered and
heated till a brown powder is thrown down, which is filtered and washed
with acidulated water; (2) Waste cotton, peat, or brown coal, heated
with an alkali; (3) Farinaceous matters carbonised by mineral acids.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Umbers.</span>&mdash;These form a large class of natural earths of a brown colour,
differing widely in the proportions of their chief constituents, but
closely allied to the ochres and siennas in general composition, and
owing their colour mainly to the presence of hydrated oxides of iron and
manganese, the latter prevailing in the umbers to a greater degree than
in the ochres and siennas, which consequently belong to the yellow group
(<i>q. v.</i>).</p>

<p>Beds or veins of umber of varying thickness and extent are found in many
places, especially in connection with magnesian limestone (dolomite).
Apparently they are often derived from decomposition of this rock,
perhaps due to the infiltration of carbonated water, which has acted
upon the calcium and magnesium carbonates in the dolomite, and left the
silica and the iron and manganese as oxides, forming the bulk of the
umber. Usually these beds of umber are near the surface, though covered
by an overburden of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> vegetable soil, and the operation of working them
may be called quarrying rather than mining, being of a superficial and
simple character, often only amounting to small pits.</p>

<p>As no umber is a definite body, but rather a mixture of various
substances, so the composition of every kind is peculiar to itself, and
very wide differences are noticeable. Even the same bed will not
necessarily produce always the same class of umber. The following
figures show the extent to which the proportions of the several
ingredients may vary:&mdash;</p>

<p>Calcium carbonate is sometimes present to the extent of 2½ to 6 per
cent., and at other times is quite absent, its place being taken by ½ to
1 per cent. of lime (calcium oxide); some of the English umbers contain
about 2 per cent. of calcium sulphate (gypsum) in addition to the
carbonate. Alumina may occur to the amount of 2½ to 12½ per cent., or
may be wanting altogether. In a sample of Derbyshire umber analysed by
Hurst there appears to have been over 30 per cent. of barium sulphate
(barytes), which looks suspiciously like adulteration.</p>

<p>Almost every variety of shade may be found in umbers. The darkest and
richest in colour&mdash;a warm violet-brown&mdash;is the so-called Turkey umber,
mined in Cyprus, and formerly shipped viâ Constantinople; this is of
very fine quality and commands the higher price in the market. A
reddish-brown Irish umber, known as Cappagh brown, obtained from the
Cappagh mines in Cork county, is much esteemed among artists, both for
water-colour and oil painting, and especially for the latter when it has
been subjected to a preliminary desiccation at a temperature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> about
170° F. Heated to the boiling point its colour changes to a rich red,
resembling burnt sienna. Cornish umbers are of fairly good quality.
Derbyshire umbers are poor, and incline to a reddish tint, besides being
gritty. Sometimes they are adulterated with a little lamp black, which
renders the tone more like that of Turkey umber, and thus deceives the
unwary buyer.</p>

<p>There are three conditions in which umbers come into commerce: (1) as
raw lump, being the mineral just as it is mined; (2) as raw powdered,
when it has been ground very fine and levigated or washed in flowing
water, whereby the particles get assorted according to their several
degrees of fineness; and (3) as burnt, being the powder after it has
been subjected to calcination in a closed furnace. Some umbers are so
soft that they can be washed without any previous grinding, but this is
not generally the case. The apparatus used in grinding and levigating is
common to all pigments where these processes are employed, and will
therefore be described once for all in a later chapter. The calcination
is conducted at a red heat, and by this process the tint is made darker
and warmer, but it must not be pushed too far or the pigment will
blacken.</p>

<p>While different samples of umber present differences of tone and shade,
from a yellowish to a violet brown, they are alike in being very durable
and proof against the injurious influences of air, light, and impure
atmospheres; ordinary acids and caustic soda have no appreciable effect.
They mix well with other pigments without provoking any change, and are
equally satisfactory as oil or water colours. They do not admit of much
adulteration, except in the substitution of an inferior grade for a
superior one, and possibly the addition of barytes as a make-weight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vandyke Brown.</span>&mdash;What the original brown used so much by the great Van
Dyke was no one can tell. The pigments now sold under the name of
Vandyke brown are of varying composition, some being simply mixtures of
red oxide of iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> and lamp black, others are natural earthy substances
after the character of Cologne earth, and others again are artificial
products of the partial carbonisation of vegetable matters, such as cork
waste. As it is uncertain what was the composition of the original
Vandyke brown, no standard of chemical purity can be established.</p>

<p>Probably the most general sources of Vandyke brown are red oxide and
lamp black, and the quality of such a pigment will chiefly depend on
securing a good black, as any traces of unburned oily matter will make
the paint difficult to dry. Almost any variety of shade can be produced
by adjusting the proportions of lamp black and red oxide, with sometimes
the addition of a little ochre. The pigment made in this manner forms
the staple brown paint for industrial application, mixing well with oil,
and being of a durable character, but it does not mix so well with
water.</p>

<p>Vandyke browns of the Cologne earth type, from earthy lignites and peaty
matter, are much used in and around the localities where they are
produced, and entail nothing more than grinding and levigation to fit
them for the market. They are in general best adapted to water-colour
painting.</p>

<p>Warm and slightly reddish tints of Vandyke brown are obtained by the
partial carbonisation of ligneous material, in other words by subjecting
cork and bark waste to moderate calcination in closed retorts. These mix
equally well in water or oil.</p>

<p>All varieties of Vandyke brown are stable pigments, without any
disturbing influence when used in admixture with other colours, and
quite proof against any change on exposure to air and light. Next to the
umbers they are the most generally useful browns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br /><br />
<b>GREENS.</b></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Green</span> pigments form an important and numerous class, but many of those
which possess the most brilliant and durable qualities contain highly
poisonous ingredients, and some of the most beautiful are not permanent.
All things considered they are perhaps the least satisfactory group of
colouring matters. The following list comprises all worth notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baryta Green.</span>&mdash;It is said that the manganate of baryta makes an
excellent green pigment, which may with advantage replace for many
purposes those greens which contain arsenic. Several methods of
preparing it have been published:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) One consists in igniting
together the nitrate of baryta and manganese oxide or dioxide. (<i>b</i>)
Another consists in fusing a mixture of pyrolusite or black oxide of
manganese, caustic bartya, and chlorate of potash. (<i>c</i>) According to a
third method, mix 2 parts caustic soda and 1 part chlorate of potash,
and gradually add 2 parts very finely powdered manganese; heat gradually
up to dull redness, then allow to cool, powder, and exhaust with water;
filter and cool, and add a solution of nitrate of baryta to the
filtrate; a violet-coloured baryta precipitate forms; this is carefully
washed, dried, and treated with ½-1 part of caustic baryta, hydrated,
and gradually heated up to redness, with constant stirring. The cooled
mass is powdered, and finally washed to remove any excess of baryta.</p>

<p>By either process a green mass is obtained, but the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> method seems
to yield a more beautiful and homogeneous product. In experimenting with
other and more direct methods for preparing a baryta green of great
purity and beauty, Fleicher has made several observations of its
properties. If a green solution of manganate of potash be precipitated,
while boiling, by chloride of barium, a heavy, granular, but not
crystalline, precipitate of manganate of barium is obtained. This
precipitate has a violet colour, approaching blue, can be washed by
decantation at first, and afterwards may be collected on a filter. On
drying the precipitate, its colour grows lighter with the increase of
temperature; and on being heated to a dark red heat, it looks almost
perfectly white, with only a shade of greyish blue. If, then, it be
heated still higher with free access of air, or in an oxidising flame,
it gradually turns green; by carrying the process farther the colour
becomes a beautiful greenish-blue, and finally, at a very high heat, a
dirty greyish-brown mass is formed from the reduction of the manganic
acid to binoxide of manganese. On adding chloride of barium to a
solution of the permanganate of potash, and boiling, a precipitate is
slowly formed of a peach-blossom colour, while the liquid retains a deep
violet colour. By decanting and bringing the mass, diluted with water,
on a filter, the precipitate is not decomposed, and can be dried at 212°
F. without changing colour. When the dry permanganate of barium is
gradually heated, its colour also grows paler, but does not, like the
manganate of baryta, acquire a green colour at a still higher
temperature; for after the colour has once vanished, an increase of
temperature soon converts it into the greyish-brown mixture of the
binoxide of manganese and baryta or carbonate of baryta. Hence it is
impossible to prepare the green manganate of baryta from the
permanganate.</p>

<p>In regard to the colour itself, experiments have shown that the most
beautiful green is that formed by igniting the manganate as described
above. The green prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> by Rosenstiehl’s process&mdash;fusing together
caustic baryta, chlorate of potash, and binoxide of manganese&mdash;is less
beautiful than the above; while that attained from nitrate of baryta and
binoxide of manganese is far inferior to either of the others. Perhaps,
however, this colour could be improved by preparing it in a
reverberatory furnace with a strong oxidising flame.</p>

<p>The blue-green baryta pigment has different shades, according to its
preparation, some being almost pure blue with only a shade of green, and
resembling the light blue quill feathers of many parrots. The greener
the colour the more it gains in intensity, but it loses in fineness,
although still surpassing the green manganate of baryta.</p>

<p>The production of the blue or bluish-green baryta is due entirely to the
alkaline property of the mass. Whether each definite colour is due to a
definite composition is doubtful, since the temperature, which must not
exceed that of a bright red heat, exerts a greater influence on the
colour. This much is however certain, that both manganic acid as well as
the permanganate of baryta, when mixed with about 20 per cent. of
hydrate of baryta and ignited at a red heat, will always produce this
blue-green colour. It is evident that the blue-green colour is dependent
entirely on its basic character; for on placing this powder in weak
acids, it first turns green and is then gradually decomposed. The baryta
pigment is quite permanent, and may be subjected to the action of strong
sulphuric acid for hours, at the ordinary temperature, before the colour
will be destroyed. Boiling potash solution has no perceptible effect
upon it. The permanence, especially of the blue shade, is increased by
adding a little baryta, which increases its alkalinity. It is also
worthy of remark that the pigment prepared from the nitrate of baryta is
much less permanent, because the nitrous acid present will after a time
exert a reducing action.</p>

<p>The baryta pigments seem especially adapted to fresco painting, because
they appear very bright and lively on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> stone, and especially on lime,
where many other pigments lose their beauty or are entirely destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bremen Green.</span>&mdash;This old-fashioned pigment is a basic carbonate of
copper, and has been produced in several ways. At first a basic chloride
or oxychloride was used, its mode of preparation varying somewhat but
without affecting the character of the result, the great essential being
that no subchloride of copper should be present. Therefore, in some
factories, it was the practice to prepare the magma of basic oxychloride
even a year in advance; or, to subject it to repeated wetting and drying
in order to ensure prefect oxidation. The method has now become
obsolete, and is superseded by the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>When neutral nitrate of copper is decomposed by an insufficiency of a
potash carbonate solution, the flocculent precipitate of copper
carbonate formed at first is gradually changed into a subnitrate of
copper which is precipitated as a heavy green powder. In practice the
operation is conducted as follows:&mdash;Copper scales are calcined in a
reverberatory or muffle furnace, till all the suboxide is converted into
protoxide, or until a sample dissolves in nitric acid without evolution
of red nitrous vapours. The copper nitrate solution is heated and
decomposed by a clear solution of potash carbonate, and when the
effervescence subsides, small doses of potash carbonate solution are
added, till but little undecomposed copper remains in the solution. To
recover this last portion, the clear liquor is decanted, and the green
precipitate is washed several times with small quantities of water. All
the liquors are collected, and the remaining copper is precipitated by
potash solution. The green carbonate of copper is introduced into a new
solution of copper nitrate, in which it is transformed into a basic
salt. The previous liquors are evaporated till they afford crystals of
nitrate of potash, which is a valuable secondary product.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brighton Green.</span>&mdash;The following recipe has been pub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>lished for making
this pigment. Dissolve separately 7 lb. sulphate of copper and 3 lb.
sugar of lead, each in 5 pints of water; mix the solutions, stir in 24
lb. of whiting, and when the mass is dry grind to powder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brunswick Green.</span>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Old process.</p>

<p>The Brunswick green of former days was closely allied to Bremen green,
essentially consisting of a basic chloride or oxychloride of copper, and
possessing all the faults incidental to that class of copper salt. While
having fairly good covering power, and capable of being used either as a
water colour or an oil colour, it was tedious and therefore expensive to
prepare, and not thoroughly durable under exposure to air and sunlight.
Nevertheless it was a useful bluish-green pigment. Following are some of
the many methods by which it has been prepared:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Poor oxidised copper ores are moistened with hydrochloric acid, and
spread out exposed to the air. The metal is thus rendered very
susceptible to the action of chlorine, and is even attacked by solutions
of ammonium chloride and of common salt. The sub-chloride produced is
rapidly transformed into oxy-chloride, and forms a fine light-green
pigment.</p>

<p>(2) Place 2 parts by weight of copper-filings in a vessel capable of
being tightly closed, and over them pour 3 parts by weight of
salammoniac in the form of a saturated aqueous solution. Keep the
mixture in a warm place for some weeks and thoroughly agitate it
occasionally. In due time the newly formed oxychloride is removed from
the vessel, and separated from the non-oxidised copper by washing on a
sieve. This washing must be continued until all traces of alkali have
been destroyed, when the pigment is drained, and very slowly dried at a
low temperature to avoid decomposition.</p>

<p>(3) Copper scrap is covered with a concentrated solution of chloride of
copper and allowed to remain until the chloride has undergone conversion
into basic chloride. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> latter is then subjected to the straining,
washing, and drying treatment prescribed in (2).</p>

<p>(4) In a lead-lined vessel, place a quantity of copper filings or waste,
and add to it two-thirds of its weight of common salt, and one-third of
its weight of concentrated sulphuric acid, the latter being however
first diluted by admixture with three times its volume of water. The
mass is left to stand, with occasional stirring till all the copper has
been transformed into oxychloride, when it is strained, washed, and
dried as in (2).</p>

<p>(5) A modification of (4) is to put the copper scrap into a wooden
vessel, and cover it with an equal weight of common salt and an equal
weight of sulphate of potash dissolved in water. After standing and
agitation as before, the oxychloride is formed, and the straining,
washing, and drying are repeated.</p>

<p>(6) A solution of crude carbonate of ammonia is added to a mixed
solution of alum and blue vitriol so long as any reaction takes place.
When it is completed, the precipitate is collected, washed, and dried as
in the other cases.</p>

<p>(7) Lighter shades are produced by the addition of alum, or of sulphate
of baryta.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) New process.</p>

<p>The modern Brunswick greens, which are made in a variety of shades, and
sometimes known as chrome greens, Prussian greens, Victoria greens, and
by other fancy names, really consist of a white pigment as a
basis&mdash;usually sulphate of baryta (barytes), but occasionally also
sulphate of lime (gypsum) and sulphate of lead&mdash;coloured green of
varying intensity and depth by addition of a blue pigment in the shape
of Prussian blue, and a yellow in the guise of chrome-yellow. There are
what may be called four distinct standard shades recognised by
colour-makers, viz. “pale,” “medium,” “deep,” and “extra deep”; but
inasmuch as every manufacturer adopts a formula of his own, there may be
appreciable differences among colours of the same nominal standard if
by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> different makers. Taken as a whole, about three-fourths of their
total weight consists of the foundation white pigment, usually barytes;
about 1 to 6 per cent. is Prussian blue, according to the shade; and 14
to 18 per cent. chrome yellow; but there are brands occasionally met
with which depart considerably from these average figures.</p>

<p>The actual ingredients employed to form these green pigments are
essentially different, according as the wet or the dry method of
combining them be adopted. In selecting the various ingredients the
following points must be borne in mind. The Prussian blue of every maker
is not the same in quality, and while the character of the blue is not
of the foremost importance when dark greens are being made, for light
shades of green, on the other hand, it is essential to select only the
best and brightest brands. In the same way the tint and quality of the
chrome yellow are liable to considerable fluctuation, and it is almost
impossible to ensure two lots having exactly the same characteristics,
consequently the only way in which a certain shade of green can be
ensured is by experimental trial with small quantities for each batch.
Middle chromes can be used for deep greens, but only the lemon chromes
for pale shades. Regarding the barytes which forms the basis of the
pigment, there are no special precautions to be observed; and the same
may be said of the gypsum, should that be adopted as a substitute for
the barytes, except that 1 part by weight of gypsum takes the place of
about 2½ parts of barytes. The latter, however, is much the more
commonly used. For the dry method of compounding Brunswick greens, the
above named ingredients are all that are required.</p>

<p>In the wet method there is this essential difference, that it is sought
to precipitate the blue and yellow colours upon the inert base by
bringing about certain reactions, and therefore while the base remains
the same as in the dry method, the colouring media are totally distinct,
consisting of lead acetate, bichromate of potash, sulphate of iron, and
yellow or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> red prussiate of potash. The chief condition to be observed
with regard to the lead acetate is that it shall be in the proportion of
slightly more than three to one of the bichromate of potash; in other
words, the bichromate should be a trifle less than one-third the weight
of the lead acetate. As to the iron salt, if commercial acetate or
nitrate of iron could be bought of constant quality or purity, that
would be the most convenient form; but failing that, recourse is had to
freshly made and good quality sulphate of iron (green copperas). It is
found that the best results are secured when the weight of the sulphate
of iron is exactly the same as that of the prussiate of potash. On the
score of economy, the yellow prussiate of potash (ferrocyanide) is
employed, but the red prussiate (ferricyanide of potassium) gives better
and more certain results, and should be adopted when making a superior
paint which will command a higher price.</p>

<p>As to the comparative merits of the wet and dry systems of mixing the
ingredients of Brunswick greens, preference must be given to the former
on the score of quality of the pigment produced, but on the other hand
it entails much more trouble and skill, and there never can be the same
degree of control over the conduct of the operation or the shade of
colour developed. The dry method, however, though much more easily
carried out, and enabling the exact shade desired to be obtained to a
nicety by adding a little more of either the blue or the yellow during
the process of manufacture, is seldom adopted, because the quality and
fineness of the tints thus secured are much inferior.</p>

<p>The modus operandi with the wet method is as follows:&mdash;The barytes, in
the requisite fine state of subdivision, is very thoroughly stirred up
with water in a capacious vessel fitted with an agitator, the water
being in sufficient quantity to make quite a fluid mass. In convenient
proximity to the barytes tank, and elevated above it, provide three
other tanks of lesser capacity furnished with means of discharging their
contents into the barytes tank. In one of these smaller tanks dissolve
the green copperas in cold water; in another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> the sugar of lead; and in
the third the bichromate and prussiate of potash together. When all the
salts are thoroughly dissolved, and while the barytes is kept in
constant agitation, admit first of all the copperas solution, then the
lead acetate solution, and finally the combined bichromate and prussiate
solution, never allowing the stirring to slacken till after the last
drop of these solutions has been introduced. When the commingling of all
the ingredients is judged to be complete, the green pigment formed is
allowed to subside, and the clear supernatant fluid is siphoned off. The
pigment is washed several times by admitting clean water, agitating and
settling, and finally is removed, drained on a filter, and slowly and
carefully dried. Many ways of arranging the apparatus will suggest
themselves, the chief point to keep in mind being to economise labour as
much as possible.</p>

<p>The dry method of mixing is simplicity itself in comparison with the
above, and merely entails putting the component materials&mdash;barytes,
chrome-yellow and Prussian blue&mdash;through an edge-runner mill
simultaneously, in the proportions adapted for producing the shade
required.</p>

<p>In giving formulæ for compounding these Brunswick greens, it must be
understood that they are not absolute, as every manufacturer adopts his
own particular proportions for a certain shade, but they form a
sufficiently approximate basis from which to work. They are all computed
for 100 lb. of barytes forming the body of the new pigment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquottt"><p><i>Pale</i>: Wet&mdash;1 lb. each copperas and prussiate, 12 lb. lead
acetate, 3¾ lb. bichromate.</p>

<p>Dry&mdash;80 lb. chrome yellow, 1¼ lb. Prussian blue.</p>

<p><i>Medium</i>: Wet&mdash;1½ lb. each copperas and prussiate, 12½ lb. lead
acetate, 4 lb. bichromate.</p>

<p>Dry&mdash;30 lb. chrome yellow, 2¼ lb. Prussian blue.</p>

<p><i>Deep</i>: Wet&mdash;2 lb. each copperas and prussiate, 13 lb. lead
acetate, 4¼ lb. bichromate.</p>

<p>Dry&mdash;30 lb. chrome yellow, 4½ lb. Prussian blue.</p>

<p><i>Extra deep</i>: Wet&mdash;3½ lb. each, copperas and prussiate, 14½ lb.
lead acetate, 4½ lb. bichromate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Dry&mdash;30 lb. chrome yellow, 7 lb. Prussian blue. </p></div>

<p>The Brunswick greens are in the front rank of green pigments so far as
covering power is concerned, and, when made from reliable materials, are
reasonably durable under the influence of air and light, in which
respect, however, they vary considerably. They can be used as water
colours, but are superior in oil paints. Precautions are necessary in
mixing them with other pigments. By the action of sulphuretted hydrogen,
or sulphur in any form, the colour is darkened to a notable degree; by
the action of acids, the chrome is destroyed and the green becomes blue;
by the action of alkalies, both the blue and the yellow constituents are
affected, and the green gives place to a reddish hue. The pale and
medium shades are yellow greens; the deep and extra deep are blue
greens.</p>

<p>These colours can be distinguished by heating them with caustic soda,
which turns them brownish in tone, owing to the destruction of the
Prussian blue. If the residue be filtered, and to the filtrate some acid
and ferric chloride be added, a blue precipitate will be obtained,
indicative of the presence of Prussian blue. On washing the residue with
water and treating with hydrochloric acid, the brown colour disappears,
and, in most cases, only a white residue of barytes is left; sometimes
the residue may have a faint yellowish colour. The solution in
hydrochloric acid will give the characteristic tests for iron. The
yellow element can be recognised by boiling in hydrochloric acid,
filtering, and allowing the filtrate to cool, when crystals of lead
chloride will deposit; these, separated out and dissolved in boiling
water, will give the characteristic tests for lead, such as a white
precipitate with sulphuric acid, and yellow precipitate with bichromate
of potash. The filtrate will have a green colour, indicative of
chromium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cobalt Green.</span>&mdash;This remarkably stable, but somewhat costly, pigment is
also known by the names of Rinmann green and zinc green, the former
after the name of the chemist who first prepared it, and the latter
because it contains a large proportion of zinc. It is in fact a
combination of the oxides of cobalt and zinc, and was originally
produced in the following manner:-½ lb. pure cobalt ore was dissolved in
4 lb. concentrated nitric acid, and added to a solution of 1 lb. zinc in
5 lb. nitric acid; the mixture was diluted with water, and a solution of
potash carbonate was added, throwing down a pinkish precipitate, which
was washed on a filter, dried, and calcined at a high temperature.</p>

<p>Wagner found that an indispensable condition was to have a protoxide of
cobalt as free as possible from foreign metals, with which object he
practised the following method:&mdash;Cobalt oxide is dissolved in three
equivalents of hydrochloric acid, and the solution is evaporated to
dryness; the residue is dissolved in six equivalents of water, and
through the solution is passed a current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas,
so long as any precipitate is formed. This precipitate consists of
sulphides of the foreign metals. The clear solution is siphoned off,
evaporated to dryness, and the residue is dissolved in water. As
required, this solution is treated with carbonate of soda, and the
precipitate, washed, and while still wet, is mixed with zinc white. The
reddish mass produced in this way is dried and calcined. The best tone
is attained by combining 9 to 10 parts of zinc oxide with 1 to 1½ parts
of cobalt protoxide.</p>

<p>Louyet has shown that if the cobaltic solution be precipitated by the
phosphate or the arseniate of potash, the corresponding salt of cobalt
thus produced possesses the property of imparting a green colour to zinc
white at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> much lower temperature than is required in the case of
ordinary protoxide of cobalt: moreover, the pigment gains in body, and
the colour gains in purity and brightness. If a small quantity of
arsenious acid is added to the ordinary mixture before calcination, the
calcined mass will assume a remarkably bright green colour; and its
structure being loosened by the disengagement of fumes of arsenious
acid, it will be easy to grind.</p>

<p>According to Barruel and Leclaire’s method, 1 lb. of pure dry sulphate
of cobalt, dissolved in hot water, is mixed with 5 lb. of zinc oxide.
The mixture is dried, and calcined for three hours at a clear red heat
in a muffle; when cooled, it is thrown into water, washed, and dried.</p>

<p>The composition of cobalt green has been shown by Wagner to vary
considerably, as is to be expected from the methods of its preparation.
The proportion of zinc oxide ranges from 71½ to 88 per cent., and the
cobalt protoxide from 11½ to 19 per cent.; in addition, there will be
fluctuating percentages of phosphoric acid, soda, oxide of iron, &amp;c.,
according to the process followed.</p>

<p>With the single exception of its costliness, cobalt green possesses
advantages over most other green pigments. It has a bright colour,
sometimes inclining to a yellowish tint, or, when phosphates are used in
its preparation, leaning to a blue shade. But it is always permanent,
not only under the influence of air and light, but also in the presence
of alkalies and any but concentrated acids; thus it may safely be
compounded with other pigments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas Green.</span>&mdash;This pigment, which is fairly permanent, and possessed
of considerable covering power, owes its name to the chemist who
proposes its use, and its colour to the oxide of chromium. The method by
which it is prepared is as follows:&mdash;Solutions of barium chloride and
potassium chromate are mixed together. To the barium chromate thus
produced is added one-fifth of its weight of concentrated sulphuric
acid, whereby partial decomposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> is brought about, resulting in a
mixture of barium chromate, barium sulphate, and chromic acid. This
mixture is dried, and calcined in a crucible at bright red heat, the
effect of which is that the chromic acid is converted into green oxide
of chromium, and, being scattered throughout the mass, imbues it with a
green colour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerald Green.</span>&mdash;This is quite an old-fashioned pigment, having been in
use some 80 years. It is a combination of acetate and arsenite of
copper, and varies in tint from a dark to a pale green, always with a
bluish cast. It possesses good covering power, and can be used either as
an oil-or as a water-colour, but particularly as the latter, and is much
used in paper staining. In composition it varies considerably, as there
are some half-dozen industrial methods of making it; but in general
terms it usually contains over 50 per cent. of arsenious acid, and about
30 per cent. of oxide of copper, together with various impurities.
Following are some of the processes by which it is manufactured.</p>

<p>(1) According to the method introduced by Liebig, 1 part of verdigris is
heated in a copper kettle with sufficient distilled vinegar to effect
its solution, and to this is added a solution of 1 part of arsenious
acid in water. The result is a precipitate of a dirty green colour,
which is dissolved in a new quantity of vinegar and boiled for some
time. In this way is obtained a new precipitate, granular and
crystalline, and exhibiting a splendid green colour. When this has been
filtered off, washed, and drained, it is boiled with one-tenth of its
weight of commercial potash, in order to deepen and brighten the colour
and destroy the bluish tint. Should the waste liquor obtained after the
filtration of the pigment from the second boiling in vinegar contain any
remaining copper, arsenious acid is added; and if arsenious acid be
present, copper acetate is added; while if acetic acid survives it may
be used again for dissolving another lot of verdigris.</p>

<p>(2) Form a paste with 1 part verdigris in sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> boiling water,
pass it through, a sieve to remove lumps, and gradually add it to a
boiling solution of 1 part arsenious acid in 10 parts water, the mixture
being constantly stirred until the precipitate becomes a heavy granular
powder, when it is filtered through calico, and dried very carefully.</p>

<p>(3) Acetate of copper is mixed with a sufficient quantity of water
heated to 122° F., to make a homogeneous and liquid paste. To 10 parts
of acetate of copper in this condition is added a solution of 8 parts of
arsenious acid in 100 parts of boiling water, the whole being then kept
in a state of ebullition. The addition of a little acetic acid helps to
develop the beauty of the colour. When precipitation is complete, the
clear liquor is drawn off, and forms a convenient solvent for the next
charge of arsenic, the operation being facilitated by adding a little
carbonate of potash, forming an arsenite of potash. The precipitate
constituting the desired green pigment is filtered off and dried at the
lowest effective temperature.</p>

<p>(4) Dissolve 5 lb. of sulphate of copper in water, and add to it a
solution of 1 lb. of lime in 2 gallons of vinegar. Mix 5 lb. of white
arsenic with sufficient water to form a paste. Add the arsenic paste to
the copper and lime mixture, and leave the whole at rest in a moderate
degree of heat. Mutual decomposition slowly ensues, with consequent
formation of the green pigment, which is filtered off, washed, and dried
with the same precaution as before.</p>

<p>When sulphate of copper is used in the production of emerald green, it
is very desirable that it shall be free from sulphate of iron, which is
a common impurity in the commercial article, and greatly detracts from
the purity and brilliance of the pigment. A good method of eliminating
this iron is to add to the sulphate of copper solution a small quantity
of a gelatinous precipitate of carbonate of copper, produced by
decomposing a copper sulphate solution by a soda carbonate solution, and
washing. On adding the gelatinous carbonate of copper, with agitation,
the iron is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> soon thrown down in flakes of oxide, and pure sulphate of
copper may be filtered off.</p>

<p>(5) Braconnot proceeds as follows:&mdash;A solution of 3 lb. of sulphate of
copper is made in a small quantity of hot water; and a second solution
of 3 lb. of arsenious acid and 4 lb. of commercial carbonate of potash
in boiling water. When the evolution of carbonic acid gas has ceased,
the two liquors are mixed together while being kept continuously
stirred; the result is an abundant precipitate of a dirty
yellowish-green colour. On adding a slight excess of acetic acid, a fine
crystalline green is developed; this is washed with boiling water on a
filter, and dried very slowly and carefully.</p>

<p>(6) A rough and ready process is to mix white arsenic with water, and
then stir in an equal weight of verdigris, allowing the mixture to be at
rest for a time in a moderately warm temperature till the pigment is
completely precipitated, when it is washed on a filter, and dried very
gradually.</p>

<p>(7) A method due to Köchlin is described in the following terms:&mdash;An
aqueous solution of sulphate of copper is made by adding 100 grammes of
the salt to 500 cc. of water. To this, when solution is complete, is
added 187½ cc. of a solution of arsenite of soda, which is of the
strength represented by 500 grammes of arsenite in 1 litre of water. The
result is that a precipitate of arsenite of copper is thrown down. This
precipitate is treated with 62 cc. of acetic acid at 11° to 12° Tw., or
half that quantity of pure formic acid, for one hour, at a temperature
ranging from 104° to 122° F. The pigment thus produced is of good
colour, but its superiority would not seem to justify the use of such an
expensive article as pure formic acid, nor the minute adjustment of the
proportions of the ingredients, in an operation to be conducted on a
commercial scale.</p>

<p>(8) Another complicated process has been invented by Prof. Galloway,
which, under skilled supervision, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> the correct proportions of
the several ingredients have been ascertained by careful experiment, may
give good results, but several precautions have to be observed which
cannot be entrusted to ordinary factory hands. The principle of the
process is that when a quantity of sulphate of copper is dissolved in
water, sufficient carbonate of soda is added to throw down one-fourth of
that copper sulphate as carbonate of copper, and then so much acetic
acid is introduced as will convert that copper carbonate into acetate.
In order to convert the balance of the copper sulphate into arsenite, a
solution of arsenic in boiling carbonate of soda is made and added to
the copper acetate solution, both solutions being at a boiling
temperature.</p>

<p>Emerald green is a pigment which possesses considerable stability in dry
pure air, but in damp atmospheres it becomes brown; in the presence of
acid or ammoniacal vapours it turns blue, and under the influence of
sulphuretted hydrogen it blackens; moreover, strong alkalies destroy it.
Consequently it cannot be used in many situations, nor in association
with such pigments as contain sulphur compounds. In decorative painting
it is difficult to apply on large flat surfaces, and necessitates
stippling in order to get it to lie well; but when stippled on a ground
of proper green it develops an exceedingly beautiful bloom-like
appearance.</p>

<p>Its peculiar shade distinguishes it from all other green pigments, none
of which approaches it in the paleness and brightness of its colour. It
can be distinguished by the fact that it is soluble in acids and
ammonia, to a blue solution which does not change on boiling. In caustic
soda it also dissolves with a blue colour: on boiling, a red precipitate
of cuprous oxide falls down. No other green pigment answers to all these
tests.</p>

<p>There are a good many imitation emerald greens on the market, some of
which are offered as genuine emerald greens, others as “emerald tint”
green, which is much more honest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> The composition of these greens
necessarily varies greatly, some are prepared from coal tar greens,
others by careful admixture of various green, blue, and yellow pigments.
If the tint of these substitutes is right and they are sold for what
they are, there is no reason why they should not be used in place of the
real article, over which they have the advantage of not being poisonous,
which is a great disadvantage of the genuine emerald green. Although one
authority disputes this point, certainly the poisonous action of emerald
green varies very considerably with different individuals. The genuine
emerald green may be distinguished from the spurious by being perfectly
soluble in acids and alkalies, which the imitations are not; the
character of the latter must be inferred by the application of a few
special tests, the nature of which will be readily deduced from what is
said as to the properties of other green pigments. Emerald green should
be assayed for purity and tint; this is important, as pure emerald green
has a tint of its own, which is difficult to imitate, and sometimes
really pure emerald green offered for sale is of a defective tint, due
to some fault in the process of manufacture. Such samples should be
rejected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guignet’s Green.</span>&mdash;The greens of this class, which owe their colour to
chromium oxide, are also known as “chrome greens,” a name which they
share with a totally different group into whose composition chrome
yellow enters as a constituent, and which have been already described
under the synonym “Brunswick greens,” on pp. 114-118.</p>

<p>Though one of the simplest of chemical products, a great many ways of
preparing chromium oxides have been proposed. One of the earliest for
industrial application was that of Guignet, who has given his name to
the pigment, and this may fitly commence the long list.</p>

<p>(1) The first method adopted by Guignet consisted in mixing bichromate
of potash with three times its weight of boracic acid and moistening the
mass with just sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> water to form it into a thick paste. This
paste is put on the hearth of a reverberatory furnace, which is
carefully heated to a point never exceeding a dark red heat; if this
precaution is neglected, the mass, instead of becoming porous, will fuse
entirely, and the anhydrous oxide will be produced, which has a
pale-green colour. The heated paste, while still red hot, is thrown into
cold water and washed with boiling water, in order to remove borate of
potash in solution; and this solution, when boiled down and treated with
hydrochloric acid, can be made to yield up most of the boracic acid it
contains. The filtered and washed residue is the hydrated oxide of
chromium.</p>

<p>(2) A modification of (1), followed by Guignet, was to replace the
bichromate of potash by chromate of soda, prepared by dissolving in
boiling water 61 parts of neutral chromate of potash and 53 parts of
nitrate of soda. For the neutral chromate of potash, also, may be
substituted a mixture of 92 parts of bichromate of potash and 89 parts
of crystallised carbonate of soda, the nitrate of soda remaining as
before. On cooling, in either case, the solution deposits much nitrate
of potash, which is commercially valuable. The chromate of soda present
in the mother liquors is obtained by evaporating to dryness. The pigment
produced by the chromate of soda process is lighter in colour than that
obtained with bichromate of potash. It may be still further paled by
adding a little alumina, baryta, or other white pigment to the
bichromate and boracic acid mixture before calcining.</p>

<p>(3) Equal quantities of potash bichromate and potato starch are
thoroughly mixed and then calcined in a crucible at a high temperature.
The product is washed with boiling water, to remove the potash carbonate
formed, and any remaining undecomposed bichromate. The precipitated
chromium oxide is filtered, dried, and again calcined to drive off the
water. The final result is a handsome pigment which flows well from the
brush.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) On heating in a crucible a mixture of 3 parts of neutral chromate of
potash with 2 parts of salammoniac, the two salts are decomposed, the
result being formation of chromium oxide mixed with potassium chloride,
which latter is removed by several washings with hot water. The
brilliancy of the chromium oxide is enhanced by calcination at a dull
red heat.</p>

<p>(5) Fuse together 3 parts of boracic acid and 1 part of potash
bichromate at a dull red heat on the hearth of a reverberatory furnace.
Thus is formed a borate of chromium and potash, with evolution of
oxygen. The mass is repeatedly washed with boiling water, which causes
decomposition, and consequent separation of hydrated oxide of chromium,
and a soluble borate of potash. The chromium oxide is washed, and ground
very fine.</p>

<p>(6) When a solution of potash bichromate is poured into a neutral
solution of mercury proto-nitrate, it forms an orange-coloured
precipitate, which is washed and gently dried, then powdered, and heated
in a stoneware retort provided with an arm dipping into cold water, by
which the mercury is distilled and condensed. The residue in the retort
is a highly comminuted chromium oxide, of a fine dark-green colour.</p>

<p>(7) On calcining potash bichromate in a crucible at a very high
temperature, it is decomposed, and results in chromium oxide and potash,
the latter of which can be washed out. The chromium oxide thus obtained
is very dense and of a dark-green colour resembling (6).</p>

<p>(8) Equal quantities of flowers of sulphur and bichromate of potash are
thoroughly mixed, and heated to redness in a crucible, producing a
mixture of oxide of chromium with sulphide and sulphate of potash. The
latter are dissolved out by washing repeatedly with hot water, leaving
the chromium oxide as a finely comminuted dense powder of an intense
green colour.</p>

<p>(9) A modification of (8) consists in adding small suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>cessive
quantities of flowers of sulphur to a boiling concentrated solution of
potash bichromate. From this results a gelatinous oxide of chromium,
which is washed with boiling water, dried, and calcined in a crucible at
a red heat.</p>

<p>(10) Hydrochloric acid decomposes bichromate of potash, forming a
soluble chloride of potash which can be removed by washing, and a
residue of chromium oxide, which is washed on a filter and dried.</p>

<p>There remain for description two or three processes in which phosphoric
acid plays a part, but the greens made by these methods do not possess
the freshness of the others, and it is difficult to see what advantages
can attend this modification.</p>

<p>(11) According to Arnaudon, 149 parts of bichromate of potash are
thoroughly incorporated with 128 parts of crystallised neutral phosphate
of ammonia, and the mixture is heated in thin layers to a temperature
between 338° and 356° F., which brings about intumescence, change of
colour, and disengagement of water and ammonia; the heating is continued
for half an hour, but must not be allowed to exceed 392° F. When the
development of the green colour is complete, the product is washed with
hot water to remove soluble salts, and the residue constitutes an
impalpable powder of chromium oxide, forming a leaf-green pigment.</p>

<p>(12) Dissolve 10 lb. of bichromate of potash and 18 lb. of phosphate of
soda in boiling water, and add to the boiling mixture 10 lb. of
thio-sulphate of soda solution and a little hydrochloric acid. A
precipitate of phosphate of chromium is gradually thrown down as the
boiling is maintained.</p>

<p>For general utility no class of pigments can exceed the several forms of
Guignet’s green. It is capable of affording a great variety of tints,
all absolutely permanent under reasonable conditions. No ordinary agent
will decompose them, and they will stand almost any test to which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
may be subjected without losing colour. They are quite insoluble in
acids and alkalies, and are not affected even by the extreme heat of the
glass furnace. They possess good covering power, do not suffer in
brightness or purity under artificial light, and are equally useful as
oil or water colours, besides being admirably adapted for fresco and
silicious painting, and employed in making green glass and in calico
printing. They can be mixed with any other pigment. Adulteration with
Brunswick or Prussian greens is often practised, but may be discovered
by a portion being dissolved on boiling with caustic soda, the solution
giving a precipitate of chrome yellow on adding acetic acid, and (a
separate portion, of course) Prussian blue with hydrochloric acid and
perchloride of iron.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lokao.</span>&mdash;This pigment, which is also known as “Chinese green,” was first
met with as a sediment left after dyeing cotton cloths with the barks of
one or more species of buckthorn, notably <i>Rhamnus chlorophorus</i> and <i>R.
utilis</i>, and passing in China under the general name of Lo-Kao. This
sediment is spread on blotting paper and thus dried, forming thin cakes.
Latterly, the juice afforded by the berries of the same trees is
extracted by pressure, absorbed by alum, and dried in the same form of
little cakes. When first introduced into England it was highly valued as
affording a pure green, even in artificial light. Its price on the
London market in 1861 was 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> an ounce. So long ago as 1853 it
was imported into France and used for dyeing silk. The colouring
principle appears to consist of a glucose (lokaose) and an acid
(lokaonic acid). In 1864, Chauvin obtained an identical colouring matter
from <i>Rhamnus catharticus</i>, or the common buckthorn, a shrub which grows
wild in most parts of Europe, and found a ready market for the pigment
at 37<i>s.</i> a pound. This was simply the article known as sap green (<a href="#Page_132">see
p. 132.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Malachite.</span>&mdash;This is one of the names applied to mountain green (q.v.).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manganese Green.</span>&mdash;Several formulæ have been published for making a green
pigment from manganese, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) An intimate mixture of 80 parts of nitrate of barium, 14 parts of
oxide of manganese and 6 parts of sulphate of barium, is placed in a
crucible and heated to bright redness until the green colour is
thoroughly developed. The fused green mass is poured out of the
crucible, cooled, and ground wet to a fine condition.</p>

<p>(2) To 3 or 4 parts of caustic baryta moistened with water are added 2
parts of nitrate of barium and 2 parts of oxide of manganese; the whole
mass is most intimately mixed, then put into a crucible in a furnace,
and subjected to a dull red heat so long as may be necessary for
securing complete decomposition. When the green colour is satisfactorily
produced, the mass in a state of fusion is poured out, cooled,
pulverised, digested in boiling water, then washed with cold water, and
finally dried in an atmosphere which is free from carbonic acid.</p>

<p>(3) The oxide of manganese may be replaced by the nitrate, when the
quantities are 46 parts nitrate of barium, 30 parts of sulphate of
barium, and 24 parts of nitrate of manganese; the fusion, grinding and
washing are repeated as before.</p>

<p>According to some recipes the powdery pigment, consisting essentially of
manganate of barium, is mixed with a little dextrine to make sure of its
stability, but it is not clear whether this is really essential.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mineral Green.</span>&mdash;This is only another name for the green made from copper
carbonate, and described under mountain green, see <a href="#Page_131">p. 131</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mitis Green.</span>&mdash;This pigment is an arseniate of copper, and bears a very
close relationship to the emerald green made according to Braconnot’s
formula, and described in the fifth paragraph of that section, see <a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a>.
Mitis green is prepared by dissolving arseniate of potash in five
times the quantity of hot water and adding a solution of an equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
weight of sulphate of copper, keeping the whole in constant agitation. A
pulverulent precipitate is formed, possessing a grass green colour. This
is washed and dried. The tint can be varied by altering the proportions
of the arseniate and sulphate. The arseniate of potash is made by
boiling arsenious acid in concentrated nitric acid, filtering, and
saturating with carbonate of potash. The arseniate is allowed to
crystallise out of the liquor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mountain Green.</span>&mdash;This pigment is also known by the names of malachite
and mineral green.</p>

<p>(1) In its native form the mineral malachite or green carbonate of
copper is very widely distributed in Europe, Asia, America, and
Australia, but on a commercial scale it is chiefly produced in the Ural
mountains of Siberia and in the Banat of Hungary. It only needs to be
picked clean from adhering rock and to be ground to a very fine powder
in order to render it ready for use. It is much superior to any of the
artificial substitutes referred to below, but its cost confines its
application to artistic work.</p>

<p>(2) Sometimes a little orpiment or chrome yellow is ground up with the
malachite.</p>

<p>(3) A very simple formula for making the artificial pigment is to add
solution of carbonate of soda or potash to a hot mixed solution of alum
and bluestone (sulphate of copper).</p>

<p>(4) Other recipes for making mountain greens have been published which
bear no relation to the composition of the original article, <i>e. g.</i> by
mixing a solution containing potash and arsenic with a solution of
bluestone; or, as a much more complicated example, treating a solution
of bluestone first with slaked lime, then with a solution of arsenic and
soda obtained by boiling in water, and finally with tartaric acid.</p>

<p>The advantages attendant on so much trouble in producing what is at best
an unstable pigment are not very apparent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris Green.</span>&mdash;This is another name, used especially in America, for the
emerald greens described on p. 121.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prussian Green.</span>&mdash;A name often applied to class <i>b</i> of the Brunswick
greens (see <a href="#Page_114">p. 114</a>), or in other words those which are prepared from
Prussian blue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rinmann Green.</span>&mdash;The first cobalt green (see <a href="#Page_119">p. 119</a>), put on the market
was made by Rinmann, and hence it is still often called by his name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sap Green.</span>&mdash;This vegetable pigment or lake is closely allied to the
Chinese green or lokao, described on p. 129.</p>

<p>It consists of the solidified juice extracted from the berries of the
common buckthorn shrub (<i>Rhamnus catharticus</i>), which is obtained either
by allowing the berries to undergo slight fermentation for about a week
in wooden tubs, then pressing and straining; or by boiling the berries,
and straining off the juice. In either case the clean juice is boiled
down to a syrupy consistence, and a little alum (about ½ oz. to the pint
of thickened juice) is added, the liquor being then evaporated to
dryness, or very nearly to that point, the drying being left to complete
itself after the pigment has been ran into bladders.</p>

<p>The quality of this green is liable to serious fluctuation, owing to the
neglect or ignorance of certain simple precautions. Thus, for a true
green the berries should be selected before they have quite reached
maturity. The more nearly ripe the berries are, the more yellow will be
the tint of the green afforded by them. The boiling of the berries, if
followed, and the evaporation of the juice, must be done at a low
temperature, and the final stages of the evaporation cannot safely be
done with direct fire heat, but should be effected in a water bath. The
only substance incorporated with the juice should be potash alum.
Sometimes it is replaced by carbonate of magnesia (which destroys the
transparency of the pigment); or by carbonate of potash (which
introduces a stickiness or viscosity).</p>

<p>Sap green possesses too little body and is too translucent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> use as
an oil paint; but being non-poisonous, and in fact perfectly harmless,
it finds many useful applications outside of water colour and pastel
painting, viz. in colouring alimentary substances such as drinks and
sweets. Its true colour is a leaf green, glossy and translucent. In
durability it is not remarkable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scheele’s Green.</span>&mdash;For more than a century has Scheele’s green been a
familiar pigment, but the reputation it enjoyed in its early days has
long since departed, and it is now to be classed among the inferior
green colouring matters. It consists essentially of a basic arsenite of
copper, and contains from 8 to more than 40 per cent. of arsenic,
according to the mode of preparation, of which there are several, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) A mixture of 2 parts of commercial carbonate of potash and 1 part of
powdered arsenious acid (white arsenic), are dissolved in 35 parts of
boiling water; the solution is filtered clear, and then added gradually
and while still warm to a filtered solution of 2 parts of sulphate of
copper until no further precipitate goes down. This latter is collected,
washed with warm water on a filter, and slowly dried without excess of
heat.</p>

<p>(2) The preceding formula is modified by making one solution of the
arsenic and the sulphate of copper, and precipitating by adding the
carbonate of potash solution till the colour is fully developed,
agitation being constantly maintained.</p>

<p>(3) Another variation is to mix the arsenic with soda crystals in
boiling water, and to pour the arsenite of soda solution thus formed
into the bluestone solution, the boiling being kept up for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>Scheele’s green has a pale yellowish cast, and mixes well with either
water or oil, but it lacks brightness, durability, and covering power,
in addition to being highly poisonous, and though once much employed in
staining wall papers, is now generally discarded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schweinfurth Green.</span>&mdash;This is an old-fashioned name for emerald green,
which has been described on pp. 121-125.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Terre Verte.</span>&mdash;Rendered into English, the name <i>terre verte</i> means “green
earth.” It is applied to a number of green-coloured earths found widely
distributed in rocks of various ages, but especially in those of a
basaltic or porphyritic character. In commercial quantity it occurs
notably in Cyprus and near Verona in Italy; the latter locality is so
important that the pigment is often known as “Verona earth.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding minor points of dissimilarity in samples from different
sources, there is a great family likeness among them, sufficient to
indicate that the essential constituent is a silicate of iron and
magnesia. The other ingredients vary with the locality producing the
mineral. The same may be said of the physical characteristics, some
specimens being soft and earthy, while others are hard and glassy. All
possess the peculiar soapy touch of the magnesian earths, and a
clay-like odour. Analysis of a Verona earth gave:&mdash;</p>

<p>The presence of copper would point suspiciously to adulteration, and in
any case should suffice to condemn the sample for use.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally there is considerable variety of tint among the many kinds of
terre verte, but they all belong to the pale greyish class, and are more
or less translucent, consequently their covering power is small. Their
value lies in their durability, and the resistance they offer to the
injurious effects of strong light and impure atmosphere. They can be
employed either as oil or water colours. The only preparation to which
the natural pigments are submitted is fine grinding and washing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Titanium Green.</span>&mdash;An excellent dark green pigment, though rather costly,
can be prepared from rutile or any titaniferous iron ore by the
following method:&mdash;</p>

<p>The ore is dressed clean, and fused with twelve times its weight of acid
sulphate of potash in a crucible. When cool, it is reduced to fine
powder, and digested at 120° F. in dilute hydrochloric acid (half water)
until solution is complete. The hot solution is filtered off from the
residue and carefully evaporated down to a syrupy consistence, when the
nearly pure titanic acid is allowed to cool in the dish and thrown on a
filter. When sufficiently drained, it is boiled in a large volume of
water containing a little ammonia, and the precipitated titanic acid is
filtered and washed.</p>

<p>If an ore is used containing carbonate of lime, it must first be treated
with dilute hydrochloric acid before the sulphate of potash is applied.</p>

<p>The titanic acid on the filter is next mixed with a concentrated
solution of sal ammoniac, and again filtered. Then it is digested in
dilute hydrochloric acid at 120° to 140° F. till the solution is
complete. On adding ferrocyanide of potassium to the acid liquor, and
bringing quickly to a boil, a precipitate of ferro-cyanide of titanium
is thrown down. This is very carefully and slowly dried, at a
temperature never exceeding 200° F.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Verdigris.</span>&mdash;The chemical examination of verdigris shows it to be a basic
hydrated acetate of copper, containing variable proportions of the
bibasic and tribasic acetates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Commercially it is prepared in districts where acetic or pyroligneous
acid can be had at small cost. Thin pieces of scrap copper are subjected
to the action of fermenting grape skins in mass, or cider refuse, for a
fortnight or three weeks; or to the influence of pyroligneous acid for
four or five days. By this means the copper surfaces are attacked by the
acetic acid being generated or liberated, and become coated with acetate
of copper. At intervals the pieces are removed, and surfaces are cleaned
of the accumulated acetate or verdigris and this is repeated till the
metallic copper has thus been completely converted. The collected
verdigris is washed, and carefully dried at a very low temperature.</p>

<p>Its composition is subject to many irregularities, and the colour varies
from green to bluish green according to the proportion of sesquibasic
acetate present. It is one of the least permanent pigments, especially
in the presence of water, and is exceedingly poisonous. At one time it
was largely used as a pigment, but is now gradually going, if indeed it
has not already gone, out of use. It can be distinguished by its
solubility in acids and ammonia, the latter giving a deep azure blue
solution. On being heated, it turns black, owing to its parting with
acetic acid and leaving the black oxide of copper behind. This should be
entirely soluble in nitric acid, the solution giving the characteristic
tests for copper. The solution should give no precipitate with chloride
of barium or nitrate of silver, and the original pigment should be
freely soluble in any acid and in ammonia without effervescence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Verditer.</span>&mdash;Green verditer is another of the copper greens which has
practically disappeared from the modern painter’s list of pigments. It
is a yellow tinted very fugitive colour, consisting of a basic carbonate
of copper, and is manufactured by treating copper solutions with
carbonate of soda, or of potash.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Verona Earth.</span>&mdash;One kind of terre verte (see <a href="#Page_134">p. 134</a>), is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> known by this
name because it is produced in the neighbourhood of Verona.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Victoria Green.</span>&mdash;This is a fancy name for the Brunswick greens
compounded from Prussian blue, and already described on <a href="#Page_114">p. 114.</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vienna Green.</span>&mdash;The aceto-arsenite of copper described under the heading
of emerald green (<a href="#Page_121">see pp. 121-125</a>), is sometimes called by this name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zinc Green.</span>&mdash;The pigments described under cobalt green (see <a href="#Page_119">p. 119</a>), as
often pass by the name of zinc greens, and in fact they contain much
more zinc than cobalt.</p>

<p>A handsome but not permanent green may be made by combining zinc with
iron instead of cobalt, in the form of a double cyanide. The process is
as follows:&mdash;Finely powdered Prussian blue is stirred into a
concentrated solution of chloride of zinc, and put by to allow the
decomposition to take place. After some time, the precipitated
ferro-zinc cyanide is thoroughly washed, and dried out of reach of the
light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br /><br />
<b>REDS.</b></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Though</span> the red pigments are an important class, they are not numerous,
and, with the exception of a few lakes, they are drawn from the mineral
kingdom. The most useful are compounds of the several metals, iron,
lead, and mercury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antimony Vermilion.</span>&mdash;This useful pigment is prepared by several methods,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) One of the earliest successful processes was that introduced by
Mathieu Plessy, which gives a scarlet product. He obtains the pigment, a
modified sulphide of antimony, by decomposition of hyposulphite of soda
in the presence of chloride of antimony. The two solutions of
hyposulphite of soda and chloride of antimony, each at 25° B., being
prepared, the next step is to pour into a stoneware vessel 4 gals. of
the antimony chloride solution, 6 gals. of water, and 10 gals. of soda
hyposulphite solutions. The precipitate caused by the water is rapidly
dissolved in the cold by the hyposulphite. The stoneware vessel is then
placed in a hot water bath, and the temperature of the contents is thus
gradually raised. At about 86° F. the precipitation of the sulphide
commences, showing orange yellow at first, but becoming darker
subsequently. When the temperature has reached 130° F., the vessel is
removed from the water bath, and the deposition of the precipitate
proceeds rapidly. The supernatant liquor is siphoned off, and the solid
residue is washed first with water acidulated by adding to it one
fifteenth of its bulk of hydrochloric acid, and then with clean water.
Finally the residue is collected on a filter, and dried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> It is
exceedingly brilliant while wet, but loses a portion of its brightness
when dried.</p>

<p>Provision must be made for disposing of the sulphurous oxide gas driven
off during the process of manufacture.</p>

<p>(2) Kopp found certain disadvantages in working by the above method, and
adopted instead the reaction of antimony chloride upon a dilute solution
of hyposulphite of lime.</p>

<p>Experiencing much difficulty in the decomposition of antimony sulphide
by hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale, he experimented on roasting
the sulphide at a moderate temperature in contact with air and steam,
whereby most of the antimony sulphide is converted into oxide, while the
sulphurous acid driven off is utilised for making the hyposulphite of
lime. This proved a most successful plan, and the resulting antimony
oxide is readily dissolved by commercial hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>During the oxidation of the antimony sulphide, a certain proportion of
antimonious acid may be produced. This is but slightly soluble in
hydrochloric acid. It may be collected, however, by saving the residues
from the treatment by hydrochloric acid, and washing them with chloride
or hyposulphite of lime, which will dissolve the adherent antimony
chloride; they are then dried, and melted with a little antimony
sulphide and quicklime, so as to transform the whole into antimony
green, the quicklime having the effect of decomposing any small residue
of antimony chloride.</p>

<p>The preparation of the hyposulphite of lime is cheaply effected by the
action of sulphurous acid on sulphides of lime, the sulphurous acid
being derived either from the roasting of the antimony sulphide, or from
pyrites or brimstone in the usual way.</p>

<p>Calcium polysulphide is prepared by boiling finely powdered sulphur and
newly slaked lime in water. Certain advantages arise from the addition
to this solution of a little powdered calcium oxysulphide, or some
quicklime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>In the reaction of sulphurous acid on calcium sulphide and oxysulphide,
sulphur is set free and forms a sulphite of lime, which, in the presence
of sulphur and undecomposed sulphide, is soon transformed into
hyposulphite, the reaction being facilitated by the rise of temperature
which takes place in the apparatus.</p>

<p>As soon as the liquor has become slightly acid, it is drawn off into a
large settling tank. If, after agitating for some time, the liquor has
not become neutralised by the undecomposed calcium oxysulphide contained
in it, this is brought about by addition of a little calcium sulphide,
and is recognisable by the appearance of a black precipitate of sulphide
of iron. After due settlement, the clear liquor is decanted, and forms a
solution of nearly pure hyposulphite of lime.</p>

<p>The production of antimony vermilion is effected from the foregoing
solutions of antimony chloride and hyposulphite of lime, in apparatus
consisting simply of a series of wooden tanks raised conveniently above
the floor, holding about 500 gals. each, and provided with steam coils
for heating their contents.</p>

<p>Sufficient hyposulphite of lime solution is run into the tanks to fill
about seven-eighths of their depth; and then into the first tank is
poured the chloride of antimony solution, in quantities of a few pints
at a time. A white precipitate is formed, and rapidly dissolves at
first; when it is slow in going into solution, even though stirred, the
addition of antimony chloride should be stopped, as an excess of
hyposulphite of lime is essential. The liquor in the tank must be
perfectly clear and limpid, and should any white precipitate remain it
must be dissolved by making small additions of hyposulphite.</p>

<p>At this stage steam is admitted into the coils, and thereby the
temperature of the solutions is gradually raised to 120° or 140° F., or
even to 160° F., while stirring is unceasingly carried on. The reaction
is soon manifested by the successive colours of the liquor, passing from
straw-yellow to lemon-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>yellow, orange-yellow, orange, orange-red, and
lastly a very deep and brilliant red. The steam is shut off from the
coil before the desired tint is arrived at, as the acquired heat and the
agitation complete the development of the colour. If the heating is
carried too far, the red gradually passes to a brown and later to nearly
black. With experience, almost any desired shade of red can be produced.</p>

<p>When the precipitate has attained the required colour, it is allowed to
settle, and the tank is covered. The clear and limpid liquor, having a
strong sulphurous odour, is let out through tap holes at various levels
in the sides of the tanks, and run by wooden gutters or leaden pipes
into a large reservoir holding a quantity of sulphide and oxysulphide of
lime. Here the sulphurous liquor regenerates a certain amount of
hyposulphite of lime.</p>

<p>The antimony chloride solution always contains a large proportion of
chloride of iron, which provides an easy means of guiding the progress
of this latter operation. All the iron remains soluble in the mother
liquors of the antimony sulphide, and as soon as they are brought into
contact with the calcium sulphide, an insoluble black precipitate of
iron sulphide is formed. So long as this remains, the mother liquors
charged with sulphurous acid have not been added in excess; but when it
disappears by conversion into soluble hyposulphite of iron, that is a
sign that the sulphurous solution is in excess. The contents of the
reservoir are then well stirred, and calcium sulphide is introduced if
necessary, until the precipitate of iron sulphide returns and remains.
It is also needful to ensure that a certain proportion of hyposulphite
of iron shall remain in solution. The clear liquor decanted off when all
the precipitate has gone down is a neutral solution of hyposulphite of
lime, containing some calcium chloride and hyposulphite of iron.</p>

<p>Another requisite precaution in this regeneration of hyposulphite of
lime is that no excess of calcium sulphide be left, or it will give an
orange-yellow tint to the vermilion; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> the hyposulphite of lime
solution is alkaline and yellow, sulphurous acid liquor must be run in
till all alkalinity is destroyed.</p>

<p>This regenerated solution of hyposulphite of lime is used like the
first. The mother liquors charged with sulphurous acid are again
neutralised in the large reservoir by new proportions of calcium
sulphide and oxysulphide, until so much calcium chloride is present that
they are useless for the purpose, say after 25 to 30 operations.</p>

<p>The antimony vermilion precipitated on the bottom of the first tank is
received into a conical cloth filter, and the liquor drained off is
passed to the reservoir. The first tank is then washed out with warm
water, which also passes through the filter. The precipitate of red
sulphide cannot be too carefully or completely washed, and finally is
filtered and slowly dried below 140° F.</p>

<p>(3) Wagner’s method of making a scarlet pigment is to dissolve 6 lb. of
tartaric acid and 8 lb. of tartar emetic in 4½ gallons of water at 140°
F., adding a solution of hyposulphite of soda at 40° Tw., and heating
the whole mixture to 180° F., whereby the red pigment is gradually
precipitated. It is collected on a filter, well washed and dried.</p>

<p>(4) The process adopted by Murdoch, in which a solution of antimony
chloride (prepared by dissolving black sulphide of antimony in
hydrochloric acid) is acted on by a current of sulphuretted hydrogen
gas, has disadvantages in the apparatus necessary, in the limited range
of tints which can be produced, and in the almost certain presence of
free sulphur in the finished pigment.</p>

<p>Antimony vermilion forms an exceedingly useful pigment, which can be
prepared in every shade of red, from orange to red-brown. It is produced
in the condition of a very fine powder, requiring no grinding, and mixes
readily with water or oil, especially the latter, and moreover does not
interfere with the drying of the oil. It possesses great covering
powers, and can be made at a low price. It undergoes no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> change in
strong light and impure air, and is insoluble in water, alcohol,
essential oils, weak acids, ammonia, and alkaline carbonates; but it is
destroyed by high temperatures, strong acids, and caustic alkalies. It
cannot be mixed with other pigments which are intolerant of sulphur, nor
with alkaline vehicles. When pure, it should consist of nothing but
antimony sulphide and a little water; the presence of iron or lead
indicates adulteration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baryta Red.</span>&mdash;An orange red may be prepared, according to Wagner, in the
form of a sulpho-antimonite of barium, by calcining in a clay or
graphite crucible at red heat for several hours a mixture of 2 parts of
finely powdered barytes, 1 part of native antimony sulphide, and 1 part
of powdered charcoal. The calcined mass is not removed until the
crucible is quite cold, as it is liable to undergo combustion. When
cold, it is boiled in water and filtered. The residue, containing some
undecomposed sulphate and sulphide of barium, is utilised in the next
batch. The pale-yellow filtrate is treated with dilute sulphuric acid,
by which sulphuretted hydrogen is driven off, and an orange precipitate
is thrown down. This is collected, washed on a filter, and dried,
constituting the pigment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassius Purple.</span>&mdash;This costly pigment is a stannate of protoxide of gold,
much used in painting on porcelain and for miniatures. It is the
precipitate which is thrown down when solutions of gold and tin
chlorides are mixed under proper conditions, according to one of the
following methods:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Buisson prepares three solutions: [<i>a</i>] a neutral solution of
protochloride of tin by dissolving 1 part of tin in hydrochloric acid;
[<i>b</i>] a solution (bichloride) of 2 parts of granulated tin in an aqua
regia containing 3 parts of nitric to 1 of hydrochloric acid, removing
the excess of acid; [<i>c</i>] a neutral solution of 7 parts of gold in an
aqua regia composed of 1 part of nitric and 6 parts of hydrochloric
acid. The gold chloride solution is largely diluted with water, and to
it is added the solution <i>b</i> of bichloride, and finally the solution
<i>a</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> of protochloride is introduced, a drop at a time, until the desired
colour is produced in the precipitate. This last is rapidly washed by
decantation, and finally dried away from the light.</p>

<p>(2) Figuier prepares a gold bichloride solution by dissolving 20 grammes
of gold in 100 grammes of an aqua regia containing 4 parts of
hydrochloric to 1 of nitric acid. The solution is evaporated to dryness
in a water bath, and the residue is dissolved in 750 grammes of water.
Into this solution, when duly filtered, pure granulated tin is
introduced, and the whole is left for some days, at the end of which
time all the gold will be in the state of stannate of protoxide; it is
collected on a filter, carefully washed, and gently dried. The residues
contain some gold, and should be preserved for subsequent operations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cobalt Pink.</span>&mdash;This costly and permanent artists’ colour is a combination
of oxide of cobalt with magnesia. It is prepared by treating carbonate
of magnesia with a concentrated solution of nitrate of cobalt; the
resulting paste is dried in a stove, calcined in a porcelain crucible,
and finally ground to a fine powder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cobalt Red.</span>&mdash;A very deep-coloured and permanent red pigment used in oil
painting is the arseniate of cobalt, which is found native in admixture
with other substances in cobalt mines, or may be artificially produced.</p>

<p>The native mineral is treated with boiling nitric acid; the solution is
filtered clear, and small portions of potash are added till all the iron
has been thrown down as arseniate. After this is completed, the mass is
allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> settle, and the clear liquor is poured off. On adding
further small portions of potash, the cobalt is also precipitated as
arseniate.</p>

<p>To prepare artificial cobalt arseniate, grey cobalt ore (sulph-arsenide
of cobalt), reduced to a powder, is mixed with a little sand and twice
its weight of potash, and fused in a crucible. The slag of mixed
sulphides which is formed is removed, and the remaining white arseniate
of cobalt is pulverised and subjected to another fusion with potash. The
slag is again removed, and the button of pure arsenide of cobalt
remaining is finely powdered and again roasted to effect conversion into
arseniate of cobalt. Lastly, it is ground very fine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colcothar.</span>&mdash;A fancy name for a kind of iron oxide pigment, described
under oxide reds (see <a href="#Page_150">p. 150</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derby Red.</span>&mdash;As a basic chromate of lead, often known as chrome red,
Derby red is closely allied to chrome yellow, the preparation of which
is described in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that all the chrome reds, from the darkest cinnabar
red to a lustreless minium red, are distinguishable simply by the size
of the crystals composing the powder, as may be easily determined under
the microscope, and that if various chrome reds of the same hue, but
with different intensities of colour, are reduced by grinding to the
same degree of comminution, the several powders will possess exactly the
same degrees of intensity of coloration, though they lose in brightness.
Therefore the conditions which give brilliancy and intensity of colour
are those which favour crystallisation.</p>

<p>On this supposition it is recommended by Riffault to adopt a plan which
dispenses with agitation, and he supports the following method:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Chrome yellow is precipitated in the usual manner, as described in a
later chapter, without sulphuric acid, and is carefully washed. After
draining, the mass is well stirred, and six or eight equal samples are
drawn from it and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> into glass vessels of equal size and thickness of
structure. To each sample is added a different volume of caustic soda or
potash lye, marking about 20° B. For instance, to 5 volumes of paste are
added 2, 2½, 3, 3½, 4, 5, &amp;c., volumes of lye. The different mixtures
are rapidly and thoroughly agitated, but the chemical reaction is
allowed to take place without any disturbance. After examination of the
quality of the products, the relative proportions of pulp and lye are
noted down for the best hues obtained. Too much lye will fail to deepen
the red colour; in fact, Derby red is entirely soluble in an excess of
lye, and forms needle-like crystals holding potash when the caustic
solution has absorbed carbonic acid from the air.</p>

<p>On the industrial scale the operation is conducted in a large tub, which
receives the mixture of pulp and caustic lye in precisely the
proportions found by experiment to give the best results. The changes in
colour soon manifest themselves, and the whole reaction is completed in
about 12 hours. At the end of that time, the lye is drawn off, and
carries with it much of the chromic acid. The precipitated pigment is
carefully washed with pure water once in the tub, and the mass is gently
stirred. The washing is continued in the filters by throwing water upon
the pulp, and in this manner there is less friction between the
crystals, which retain their deep colour. Of course a highly crystalline
dark red cannot possess great covering power.</p>

<p>(2) Prinvalt mixes together 100 lb. of lead carbonate and 30½ lb. of
potash bichromate neutralised with caustic potash, in 50 gallons of
water, leaving them in contact for a couple of days under repeated
agitation. About half an hour’s boiling then suffices to develop the red
colour. After settling, the supernatant liquor is drawn off, and the
precipitated pigment is washed twice with pure water and finally with
acidulated water (1 lb. sulphuric acid in 10 gallons of water), and
dried.</p>

<p>There are several other recipes published which differ in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> detail from
(2), but they do not demand a lengthy description.</p>

<p>(3) 100 lb. of lead carbonate (white lead) made into a paste with water,
then added to and boiled with a solution of 50 lb. of potash bichromate
and 15 lb. of caustic soda of 77 per cent. Remainder of process as
before.</p>

<p>(4) 4 cwt. of lead monoxide (litharge) and 60 lb. of salt dissolved in
50 gallons of water, and left with agitation for 4 or 5 days; then
boiled for 2 hours with solution of 150 lb. of potash bichromate.</p>

<p>(5) 100 lb. of lead carbonate (white lead) made into a paste with water,
then added to a solution of 30 lb. of potash bichromate and 12½ lb. of
caustic soda at 77 per cent., and boiled.</p>

<p>Derby red possesses great covering power and considerable brilliancy;
but if not very carefully washed it is liable to retain a little alkali,
which renders it unstable. Otherwise, it well resists damp, strong
light, and impure air so long as sulphuretted hydrogen is absent. Taken
altogether it is not one of the best red pigments, and its consumption
is declining.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian Red.</span>&mdash;This is one of the names for the red pigments due to oxide
of iron, and is described under oxide red, p. 150.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lead Orange.</span>&mdash;Equally well known as chrome orange, this pigment may be
regarded as a Derby red in which the reactions have been curtailed. That
is to say, the yellow normal lead chromate being in excess, the red
chromate formed by the action of the alkali combines with that excess of
the yellow salt and forms a yellow-red, i.e. orange. Obviously,
therefore, a great variety of tints can be produced by altering the
proportions of the alkali, and this is further regulated by the duration
of the boiling, while the tint can also be weakened by admixture of
barytes or gypsum. The better kinds of lead orange are prepared with the
aid of caustic potash or soda as the alkali, while the cheaper sorts
depend on lime. The operations are practically identical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> with those
adopted in the case of Derby red (see <a href="#Page_145">p. 145</a>), the chief differences
lying in the proportions of the ingredients. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) <i>Pale.</i>&mdash;Add a thin cream made from 10 lb. of quicklime to a
chrome yellow made from 100 lb. of lead acetate, 30 lb. of soda or
potash bichromate, and 21 lb. of soda sulphate. Boil.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Pale.</i>&mdash;Add a thin cream of 10 lb. of quicklime to a chrome
yellow made from 200 lb. of baryta sulphate, 100 lb. of lead
acetate, and 35 lb. of potash bichromate. Boil.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Deep.</i>&mdash;Precipitate a chrome yellow by adding 35 lb. of soda
or potash bichromate to 100 lb. of lead acetate; settle. Draw off
supernatant liquor and admit solution of 9 lb. of caustic soda at
77 per cent.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Deep.</i>&mdash;Add a cream of 10 lb. of quicklime to a chrome yellow
made from 100 lb. of lead acetate, 75 lb. of baryta sulphate, and
35 lb. of potash bichromate. Boil.</p></div>

<p>In characters the lead oranges resemble Derby red (see <a href="#Page_145">p. 145</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minium.</span>&mdash;The important red pigment known as minium or red lead is
composed of two oxides of lead in combination, viz. about 65 per cent.
of protoxide and 35 per cent. of binoxide. In its preparation, metallic
lead is first converted by roasting into protoxide (termed “massicot,”
“dross,” or “casing”) and this protoxide is further subjected to heat in
a reverberatory furnace whereby a portion of it is changed into
binoxide. It is also possible to produce red lead by the decomposition
of the carbonate of lead (white lead) at a high temperature, but this
does not seem to be an industrial process. The following methods are
recognised:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The practice in France, as carried on near Tours, at the white lead
works using the Thénard process, is to calcine the best metallic lead in
reverberatory furnaces built in the rock. These furnaces are five in
number, with double fireplaces, four being constantly in operation,
dealing with about 4000 lb. at a charge, and using bituminous coal as
fuel. Each furnace is nearly circular in shape and about 11 feet in
diameter, with a fire-place on each side of the hearth. The latter is
constructed of fire-brick containing as little silica as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> possible, and
is made hollow so as to retain the metallic lead when the heat has
rendered it fluid.</p>

<p>The products of combustion from the side fire-places, having heated the
hearth and its contents, pass through an aperture in front of the
charging door of the hearth, and thence go to furnish heat to an upper
hearth where the conversion of the oxide into red lead takes place.</p>

<p>A period of about 12 hours is occupied in the oxidation of a charge,
which is repeatedly “rabbled.” Even then a considerable amount of the
metallic lead remains unoxidised and is returned to the calciner with
the next charge. Half the oxide is utilised for making white lead, as
described in a later chapter, and the other half is converted into red
lead by the method detailed hereunder.</p>

<p>The crude oxide is pulverised in a small mill and separated from the
unconverted metal. The mill takes the form of a flat circular cast-iron
plate on which rotates a cast-iron muller. Water and an agitating
arrangement are also provided.</p>

<p>As the muller revolves the material undergoes comminution, and the small
particles of oxide as formed are disturbed by the agitator and kept in
suspension in the water, by the overflow of which they are continuously
carried away into settling pits. The residual metallic lead is not
pulverised, and of course never becomes suspended in the water,
consequently it accumulates at the bottom of the mill, whence it is
occasionally withdrawn for re-calcination.</p>

<p>Sufficient oxide having collected in the settling pits, it is
transferred to a shallow pan heated by the waste heat from the furnaces
and is there rendered almost dry. In this state it is put into small
square dishes made of sheet iron, and adapted to hold about 30 lb. each.</p>

<p>A charge consists of a hundred of these dishes, which are placed in the
heated furnaces at the end of each day. The roasting is repeated several
times, and the product is accordingly known as “two fires,” “three
fires,” <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>&amp;c. The material at this stage is lumpy and coarse, and has to
undergo dry pulverisation, the fine particles as they are produced being
drawn off by means of a pneumatic fan, and collected.</p>

<p>(2) What may in contradistinction be called the English method of making
minium does not differ materially from the preceding. The “drossing”
furnace, where the metallic lead is first oxidised, receives a smaller
charge as a rule, and perhaps greater care is given to the rabbling, and
to the regulation of the temperature so that it is only just above the
melting point of the metallic lead, and not sufficient to fuse the
massicot.</p>

<p>Minium or red lead is one of the most important and useful red pigments,
as it mixes well with oil, has good covering power, dries quickly, and
is permanent except in presence of sulphur or sulphides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orange Mineral.</span>&mdash;The pigment known as orange mineral or orange lead is
simply minium which has been imperfectly calcined. Consequently it is
almost identical with red lead in composition, qualities, and method of
manufacture, the only exception being that, as the calcination is not
carried quite so far, therefore the colour is not so fully developed,
and is an orange rather than a red. As with minium, practically the only
adulterant is iron oxide red, which may be detected by boiling the
pigment to a colourless solution with nitric acid, when addition of
prussiate of potash will give a blue precipitate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oxide Reds.</span>&mdash;Under various names&mdash;such as Persian red, light red, Indian
red, scarlet red, rouge, colcothar, red oxide, purple oxide, &amp;c.&mdash;many
pigments, of which the base is the ferric oxide Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, are now
made. These vary in shade from a deep scarlet red to a dark violet. They
are obtained both from natural and artificial sources. Oxide of iron
occurs naturally as the mineral hematite, and some varieties of this are
bright enough and soft enough to be used as pigment when ground up.
These are usually nearly pure oxide of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> iron. Then the ochres, when
calcined, yield red pigments known as light red, Indian red, &amp;c., and a
good many reds are obtained from this source. The composition of these
is variable, being dependent upon that of the ochres from which they are
made, and these, as has already been pointed out, vary very much. Then,
in preparing fuming sulphuric acid from copperas, oxide of iron which is
specially sold as rouge, is obtained. Colcothar is produced as a
residue; this is nearly pure oxide of iron, and usually has a red
colour. In the manufacture of sulphuric acid from pyrites, a dark violet
oxide of iron is left as a residue, and much of this is used as a
pigment under the name of purple oxide. Then a large quantity of oxide
of iron reds are made artificially from waste liquors obtained in copper
refining, galvanising iron, &amp;c. The composition of the oxide of iron
reds, therefore, is very variable.</p>

<p>The whole group of oxide reds is of foremost importance, by reason of
their good colour, covering power, and durability, besides which, being
mostly bye-products of much more important manufactures, their cost is
reasonable.</p>

<p>The methods of preparation of oxide reds vary slightly in detail
according to the material from which they are made, but the general
features of the processes are almost identical and eminently simple. The
principal sources are impure native oxides of iron, such as the ochres,
various waste liquors containing iron salts in solution, and copperas
(protosulphate of iron).</p>

<p>(1) Native oxides. The iron present in the ochres and similar native
earths exists in the form of hydrated oxide, and has a brown red colour.
For many purposes this hue is satisfactory, and the preparation of such
a pigment consists simply in grinding the mineral in a wet mill,
subjecting it to levigation till all grit is removed, and drying.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a brighter red from the native oxides they must be
calcined to effect dehydration. This can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> accomplished in the most
rudimentary forms of furnace, and many kinds are in use. The colour
produced depends on the degree and duration of the heat to which the
material is exposed, the shade becoming deeper as the roasting is
prolonged or the temperature increased. As no two samples of ochre are
just alike it is impossible to fix a precise time for the length of the
operation, and therefore it is necessary to repeatedly draw samples in
order to judge of the progress of the dehydration and development of the
colour desired. When the requisite shade is attained, the charge is
drawn and allowed to cool.</p>

<p>(2) Waste Products. The pyrites cinders from sulphuric acid works afford
an abundance of oxide of iron. When the pyrites has contained no copper,
the cinders merely require grinding and levigating, the iron being
present as oxide. But when the pyriteshas been treated for the recovery
of the copper, by a second roasting with salt, the liquors contain the
iron as chloride and sulphate, and lime has to be added to precipitate
the oxide. This last is dried and calcined in the same manner as the
native oxides, and grinding and levigation can be dispensed with.</p>

<p>The liquors from galvanising works contain acid sulphate of iron (green
copperas) in solution. To correct the acidity, more iron is added in the
form of scrap. Then lime or other alkaline substance is introduced to
throw down the iron as oxide, and this last is filtered out, dried, and
calcined in the usual way.</p>

<p>(3) Copperas. Where beds of common iron pyrites occur, the iron sulphide
is converted into sulphate by exposure to the oxidising influence of the
air. The result is an acid sulphate of iron, which is leached out and
neutralised by addition of more iron in the form of scrap. The neutral
sulphate is crystallised out of the liquor, and calcined in a muffle
furnace, the shade of the ultimate product being governed by the degree
or duration of the roasting. The sulphurous acid liberated in the
roasting is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> utilised for making sulphuric acid, but is more
often wasted, because, to be commercially successful, the sulphuric acid
manufacture must be conducted on a large scale, demanding 100<i>l.</i> of
capital for every 1<i>l.</i> necessary for the copper and red oxide
fabrication.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Persian Red.</span>&mdash;A name which is used somewhat indiscriminately both for
Derby red (p. 145) and for oxide red (p. 150).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Realgar.</span>&mdash;The native mineral realgar is a yellow-red bisulphide of
arsenic, often called also ruby of arsenic, or arsenic orange. It occurs
native in very limited quantities in some of the older rocks, and then
only requires to be ground and levigated. But for painters’ purposes it
is prepared artificially by heating a mixture of sulphur and arsenic in
such a way that they are melted in company and react on each other to
form the arsenic sulphide. The heating takes place in crucibles, and the
proportions are two parts by weight of arsenious acid (white arsenic) to
one of flowers of sulphur. When the reaction has ceased, the contents of
the crucible are allowed to cool, and then reduced to very fine powder.</p>

<p>The pigment is exceedingly poisonous and not remarkably durable, besides
which, it cannot be mixed with any other pigment which is affected by
sulphur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red Lead.</span>&mdash;A common name for minium, see <a href="#Page_148">p. 148</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rouge.</span>&mdash;One of the names for a particular shade of the oxide reds, <a href="#Page_150">see
p. 150.</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Venetian Red.</span>&mdash;A fancy name for a special shade of oxide red, see <a href="#Page_150">p. 150</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermilion.</span>&mdash;This old pigment is gradually going out of use; the newer
reds, which are more brilliant in colour and cheaper, are gradually
displacing it, although it is doubtful whether it will ever go
completely out of use. It is the mercuric sulphide HgS. When pure, it is
not attacked by acids or alkalies; only aqua regia, a mixture of
hydrochloric and nitric acids, is capable of dissolving it, when it
forms a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> clear solution. Heated in the flame of a Bunsen burner, it is
completely volatile, a property possessed by no other pigment in common
use, therefore any adulteration can be readily detected by simply
heating a little vermilion in a crucible; if a known weight is taken and
the residue is weighed, the amount of adulteration can be ascertained.
Vermilion is chiefly adulterated with oxide of iron and orange lead.
From the character of the residue left on heating in a crucible, the
kind of adulteration can be readily ascertained.</p>

<p>(1) The following notes are taken from Christy’s translation of a
brochure on the Imperial Quicksilver Works at Idria, Krain:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the oldest times of the existence of the present works, vermilion was
manufactured. In the beginning it was merely pure pulverised cinnabar
ore, then later it was a product made by sublimation from this
substance; and there were formerly other works for vermilion manufacture
than those for quicksilver production. When the Venetians and Dutch
began to produce better wares, the production here sank steadily.</p>

<p>The researches of Christofoletti, 1681, and of Baron Richtenfels, 1726,
for the improvement of Idrian vermilion, met with as little success as
those of some Venetian women&mdash;1740-1741&mdash;who had lost their husbands in
the Venetian works and had offered themselves to manufacture vermilion
according to the Venetian method.</p>

<p>After Hacquet had strongly urged the manufacture of vermilion,
Oberhüttenmeister Ignaz v. Passetzky succeeded, with the Dutchman Gussig
assisting him, in making beautiful cake cinnabar in 1782, and in 1785
vermilion also, in the newly-built works on the right bank of the
Idriza.</p>

<p>In 1796 Oberhüttenverwalter (manager of the works) Leopold v. Passetzky
introduced the sublimate and precipitate manufacture, but it was
abandoned as unprofitable in 1824.</p>

<p>The many foreign attempts to manufacture vermilion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> the wet way
caused similar ones here, as those of Fabriks-Controlor Rabitsch in
1838, and later of Hüttenverwalter M. Glowacki, which brought large
amounts of the vermilion so manufactured into the market. Still this
manufacture came to no full development, and became forgotten, until,
finally, in the years 1877 and 1878, experiments led to its being
discontinued on account of the costliness and uncertainty of the method.
A new set of experiments in 1878 and 1879, by Assayer E. Teuber and
Director of Works (Hüttenverwalter) H. Langer, under the direction of
the Imperial Agricultural Ministry, led to favourable results. A new
manufactory, set in operation in 1880, furnishes three sorts of
vermilion manufactured in the wet way.</p>

<p>The arrangements of the works for the manufacture of vermilion in the
dry way consist of:&mdash;One sulphur stamp battery. One amalgamating plant
with eighteen small barrels; both pieces of apparatus being driven by a
two horse-power water-wheel. Four sublimation furnaces, each with six
retorts of cast iron. Four vermilion mills, each driven by a water-wheel
of 2·5 horse-power. Kettles and vats for heating, digesting, and
refining the ground cinnabar. One drying hearth. The preparation of
vermilion as an article of commerce, falls into several separate
operations, viz.:</p>

<p>1. Amalgamation; i. e. preparation of the raw mohr.</p>

<p>2. Sublimation; i. e. preparation of the cake cinnabar.</p>

<p>3. Grinding of the cake cinnabar, refining and drying of the vermilion.</p>

<p>For the preparation of the raw mohr, for each charge of eighteen kegs
there are taken 80·64 kg. (117½ lb.) powdered and sifted sulphur, and
423·36 kg. (731½ lb.) of quicksilver.</p>

<p>The amalgamating kegs each contain 28 kg. (61½ lb.) of the charge, and
are given intermittent rotating motion by a rack and pinion driven by a
water-wheel. After an average of two and three-quarter hours, the
amalgamation is complete, and the raw mohr is taken from the casks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>For the sublimation, four furnaces are used, each with six pear-shaped
cast-iron retorts of considerable thickness. Each is charged with 58 kg.
(127½ lb.) of mohr, the mouth covered with a loosely placed sheet-iron
helmet, the furnace being slowly fired; the combination of the sulphur
and the quicksilver then results in about fifteen minutes, with a
detonation. As soon as this operation (das Abdampfen) is over, a clay
helmet is placed over the retort, and the firing is increased, so that
after two hours and twenty minutes the excess of sulphur evaporates from
the tube. The condenser is now added (Stückperiode&mdash;Cake-period) and
luted, then the firing is still more urged, whereupon the cinnabar
volatilises and deposits itself upon the glazed earthenware condensation
apparatus (tube, helmet, &amp;c.). After four hours, the sublimation is
complete, and there is furnished by the helmet 69 per cent., by the
tubes 26 per cent., by the condenser (Vorlage) 2 per cent., cinnabar.</p>

<p>The grinding of the cake cinnabar takes place in four mills driven by an
undershot water-wheel. These mills have a fixed under and upper movable
stone, and the grinding is done with water. The vermilion which leaves
the spout and runs into glazed clay vessels has a temperature of about
100° F., that of the air being 59° F. The millstones make forty
revolutions per minute, and after each passage of the charge are placed
nearer together.</p>

<p>(2) A German chemist named Fleck has discovered that when a warm
solution of hyposulphite of soda is added to a double salt of mercury,
such as chloride of mercury and sodium, the solution becomes acid, and
black sulphide of mercury is deposited. But if the hyposulphite solution
is added in excess, and the temperature is not allowed to rise beyond
140° F., the solution remains neutral, and red sulphide of mercury, or
vermilion, is deposited. The least quantity of acid causes the
production of the black sulphide. The presence of a salt of zinc
facilitates the production of the vermilion. The best method is as
follows:&mdash;To four equiva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>lents of hyposulphite of soda mixed with four
equivalents of sulphate of zinc in diluted solution, is added, drop by
drop, a solution containing one equivalent of corrosive sublimate. The
whole is gently heated for 60 hours, at a temperature of 112° to 130° F.</p>

<p>(3) The following account of vermilion manufacture in China appeared
over the initials T. I. B., in the <i>Chemical News</i>.</p>

<p>The Chinaman has no knowledge whatever of chemistry, and of the
principles of natural philosophy and statics generally his notions are
of the most rudimentary and primitive description. How, then, in the
face of these obvious disadvantages have the Chinese contrived to place
themselves in the front rank amongst nations in the matter of certain
chemical manufactures, one of the most important of which is the subject
of this article&mdash;Vermilion?</p>

<p>We have seen with what ingenuity and pertinacity in carrying out his
ends the Chinaman has succeeded in making perhaps the most delicate and
perfect iron castings in the world. He has succeeded in that instance,
not by any deep researches into the hidden mysteries of Nature, by no
process of thought involving an enquiry into the “reason why”; to this
the Chinaman is averse, the whole tendency of his education, such as it
is, tends to make him satisfied with observing effects; it is sufficient
to him to know that things are so, without going into troublesome or
elaborate investigations into those changeless laws of Nature into which
his philosophy teaches him that, as he cannot alter or control, research
is fruitless: but that he has in his own small, ingenious, patient way
observed effects to very good purpose, the unrivalled excellence of some
of his manufactures testifies.</p>

<p>We will now enter a vermilion manufactory and watch the process from the
first stage of mixing its two ingredients&mdash;mercury and sulphur&mdash;to the
final process of weighing and packing this costly and beautiful pigment
for the market.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The first objects to attract the visitor’s attention on entering the
yard attached to the works will probably be large piles or stacks of
charcoal, crates or baskets of broken crockery ware, and numerous rusty
old iron pans of somewhat similar shape to rice pans, but considerably
thicker and heavier. There will also probably be a few broken and
disused cast-iron mortars. All these articles are the cast off or worn
out implements of the manufacture, and will be described in their proper
order.</p>

<p>On entering the factory proper, scores of little stone mills, each being
turned by one man, and other long rows of workmen weighing out and
wrapping up the vermilion, will be seen. The furnaces are then arrived
at: there may be a score or more in number, and may be ten or twelve in
each furnace room, five or six on each side. After passing these, the
stores of quicksilver, sulphur, alum, glue, new spare iron pans,
serviceable crockery ware, and sieves and other utensils used in the
factory are arrived at, and this completes the view of the works.</p>

<p>The iron pans in which the vermilion is sublimed are those referred to
above; they are circular and hemispherical in shape; all are of the same
size and weight; they are cast upside down, and in the casting, a runner
or lump of iron, two and three-eighths inches in diameter by from
six-eighths to one inch in depth, is purposely left on every pan in
order to enable the workman the more readily to handle the pan when
stirring up its contents. The size of the pans proved by actual
measurement to be 29¼ inches in diameter, by 8⅞ inches deep, and the
weight 40 catties, or say about 53 lb.</p>

<p>These pans are set in rows of 5 or 6 on each side of a small rectangular
room, in size some 12 feet by 15 feet; the door of this room is of wood
and contains an aperture a few inches square in order to enable the
workman to watch the progress of his operation, from time to time,
without the necessity of lowering the temperature of the apartment by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
opening the door. The pans are set in brickwork, each pan having beneath
it a grate to hold the charcoal used as fuel. There is no communication
between the grates or furnaces under each pan, and no chimney, the
flames and products of combustion finding exit from the front of the
grate, which is left wholly open at all stages of the operation.</p>

<p>The process of manufacture is as follows:&mdash;Taking an iron pan which is
of 4 inches smaller diameter than those described, and also in all other
respects proportionally less, except the runner, which is of the same
size, a skilled workman proceeds to weigh out 17⅓ lb. of sulphur. This
he places in the pan, and adds about half the contents of a bottle of
quicksilver. The pan with its contents is then put upon a small earthen
brazier or portable furnace, the fuel used in which is charcoal. When
the sulphur is sufficiently melted, the workman, taking an iron spatula
or stirrer, rapidly stirs up the quicksilver with the sulphur, and
gradually adds the remaining contents of the bottle of quicksilver,
stirring the two ingredients together meanwhile until the mercury has
wholly disappeared, or “been killed,” as the Chinese put it.</p>

<p>When this takes place, the pan is removed from the fire, a small
quantity of water is added, and rapidly stirred up with the contents of
the pan, which have now assumed a dark blood-red appearance and
semi-crystalline structure. This mass is then turned out of the pan into
an iron mortar, and then broken up into a coarse powder. This forms a
charge for one of the large pans previously described, and when
sufficient material has been prepared to charge all the pans in one
furnace chamber the sublimation is proceeded with as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>All the pans having received their quantum of crude vermilion, this is
covered with a number of crockery-or porcelain-ware plates, of tough,
strong manufacture, each about 8 inches in diameter; some of these
plates, however, are broken up, and are in a more or less fragmentary
con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>dition. When these plates have been piled up into a dome-shaped heap
of the same shape as the bottom of the upper pan, to which they should
extend, the whole is covered with one of the smaller pans previously
described.</p>

<p>Now it will be remembered that the smaller pan was of 4 inches less
diameter than the larger one; there will consequently be a circular
space two inches all round between the circumferences of the pans.
Consequently the rim of the upper or covering pan will be about 2 inches
lower than the rim of the lower pan; there will also be some 4 inches
space horizontally between the rim of the large lower pan and that
portion of the smaller pan which is at the same height as the rim of the
larger one. This space is carefully filled with a clay luting into which
some holes, generally about four in number, are pierced, extending down
to the rim of the smaller pan or cover; this is done in order to allow
the heated air and other matters to escape.</p>

<p>All the pans in one furnace chamber being thus charged and covered, the
fires are lighted. The flames from the charcoal should occasionally play
several feet above the mouths of the furnaces. The door of the chamber
is kept closed, except when it is open for a moment in order to enable
the workmen to replenish the fires, which must be kept up at a fierce
heat for eighteen hours. During this process a blue lambent flame is
seen to play above each of the four holes which are pierced through the
clay luting of the pans, so it is evident that a considerable quantity
of either one or probably both the ingredients is wasted. After eighteen
hours the fires are allowed to go out, and the contents of the pan cool
down.</p>

<p>When this is accomplished, the greater portion of the vermilion will be
found adhering to the lower surface of the broken-up porcelain plates
with which the crude product is covered. The vermilion is then carefully
removed from the porcelain by means of chisels, and is now ready for the
elutriating mills. Another portion of vermilion of not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> good quality
is found adhering to the upper iron pan, and that obtained by washing
the clay luting in a cradle, as diggers wash dirt for gold. This,
together with the wipings and scrapings generally, is mixed up with alum
and glue-water into cakes, and, after drying on a brick surface heated
beneath by means of wood or charcoal, is powdered up on a mortar, and
re-sublimed when a sufficient quantity has accumulated.</p>

<p>The vermilion which was removed from the porcelain plates is of a
blood-red colour and crystalline structure. This is then powdered up in
a mortar and removed to the levigating mills. These are the ordinary
little horizontal stone mills used by Chinese and other natives of the
East to grind rice and other grain into flour or pulp, as the case may
be. Each stone is about 2½ feet in diameter; the lower stone is
stationary, the upper is turned by a direct-acting piece of wood having
a hole in it which works a wooden peg affixed to the upper stone, which
is made to revolve by a backward and forward movement of the piece of
wood, or handle, some 3 or 4 feet long, previously mentioned. One man
turns each mill. The upper stone has a small hole in it near its centre,
down which the workman from time to time pours a little spoonful of the
powdered vermilion, which he washes down into the mill with water; as he
turns the mill, the workman keeps continually ladling little spoonfuls
of water down the aperture or hole in the upper stone; the ground and
thus elutriated vermilion, as it escapes from between the stones, is
washed down by the water into a vessel placed beneath to receive it.</p>

<p>When work is suspended for the evening, the ground vermilion is
carefully stirred up with a solution of glue and alum in water, in the
proportion of about an ounce of each to the gallon. The glue has been
made to mix with the water by previously heating it with a small
quantity of water; the earthen pots in which this process is effected
each hold about 6 gallons. The mixture is then left to settle. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
following morning the mixture of glue and alum is poured off the
vermilion, and the upper portion of the cake of vermilion at the bottom
of the vessel&mdash;that is, the portion which remained longest suspended in
the liquid&mdash;will be found to be in a much finer state of subdivision
than the lower portion, which requires to be again elutriated as on the
previous day: this separation of the more finely divided vermilion from
that which was coarser, by suspension in a dense medium, is a really
most ingenious process, for which we should give the Chinaman every
credit.</p>

<p>The process of grinding, elutriation, and separation of the coarsely
ground from the fine vermilion, sometimes requires to be several times
repeated, in order to fully bring out the colour. As a final process the
damp cake of finely ground vermilion is stirred up with clean water, and
allowed to settle down until the next morning, when the water is
carefully poured off into large wooden vats to still further deposit a
small quantity of vermilion yet remaining in suspension, and the
vermilion is dried in the open air on the roof of the premises.</p>

<p>When quite dried, the cakes of now full-coloured pigment are carefully
powdered, and sifted by means of square muslin-bottomed sieves,
contained in a covered box some 2 feet high by 2½ wide, in which the
sieves, which slide on a framework inside the box, are jerked backwards
and forwards by means of a handle on the outside of the box or case
containing them.</p>

<p>The now fully-prepared vermilion is removed to the packing house, where
may be seen rows of workmen, men and boys, seated before a series of
tables. Between every two workmen is a third, with a small pair of
scales, which he holds in his left hand; and as the workmen on either
side place before him the little pieces of paper in which the vermilion
is to be wrapped up, he weighs into each paper one tael (about an ounce
and a third avoirdupois) weight of vermilion; the papers are two in
number, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> inner a black or prepared paper, and the outer a piece of
ordinary white paper. After being wrapped up, the packets are placed in
rows before another workman, who stamps them with a seal containing in
Chinese characters the name and address of the manufactory in which the
article has been made, and the quantity and quality of vermilion
contained in the packet.</p>

<p>The rapidity and deftness of the Chinese workmen at this employment is
really surprising; the stamping, for instance, is effected at the
average rate of sixty impressions per minute, and the wrapping up is
carried on with proportionate rapidity. The mixture of alum, which is
the ordinary aluminium potassium sulphate, with the vermilion, in one of
its stages of manufacture as described above, is not added, as at first
sight we thought it might be, merely to assist in clarifying or
purifying the water by causing it to deposit its sediment, but seems to
have some peculiar effect upon the colour, although what may be the
<i>rationale</i> of the process, or how it acts, we cannot quite clearly see.
The glue is added as described above merely to favour separation of the
finely elutriated vermilion by holding it longer in suspension than the
coarser particles, which sink first, and may therefore be separated in
their order of stratification.</p>

<p>The actual composition of vermilion is 100 parts of mercury to 16 of
sulphur, when both these ingredients are in a perfectly pure state; the
excess of 5⅓ lb. of sulphur added by the Chinese is probably volatilised
and lost in the process of sublimation, or, as the sulphur used is
generally not quite pure, a part may go for foreign matter contained in
the sulphur; the balance being probably the <i>raison d’être</i> of the blue
lambent flame seen playing over the apertures in the luting during the
sublimation process. For a people having, like the Chinese, no
acquaintance with even the first rudiments of chemistry, the proportion
of ingredients taken&mdash;56¼ catties to 13 catties, or say 75 lb. to 17⅓
lb.&mdash;shows wonderfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> accurate powers of observation and a knowledge
of combining proportions only to be gained by much experience and a long
extended series of careful observations highly creditable to the
manufacturers. The entire process is one of the most ingenious and
interesting to be seen in any part of the world.&mdash;(T. I. B.)</p>

<p>Another and briefer account of the Chinese vermilion manufacture is
given by H. Maccallum, in the Proceedings of the Pharmaceutical Society.</p>

<p>He says there are three vermilion works in Hong Kong, the method of
manufacture being exactly the same in each. The largest works consume
about 6000 bottles of mercury annually, and it was in this one that the
following operations were witnessed:&mdash;</p>

<p>First Step.&mdash;A large, very thin iron pan, containing a weighed quantity,
about 14 lb., of sulphur, is placed over a slow fire, and two-thirds of
a bottle of mercury added; as soon as the sulphur begins to melt, the
mixture is vigorously stirred with an iron stirrer until it assumes a
black pulverulent appearance with some melted sulphur floating on the
surface; it is then removed from the fire and the remainder of the
bottle of mercury is added, the whole being well stirred. A little water
is now poured over the mass, which rapidly cools it; the pan is
immediately emptied, when it is again ready for the next batch. The
whole operation does not last more than ten minutes. The resulting black
powder is not a definite sulphide, as uncombined mercury can be seen
throughout the whole mass; besides, the quantity of sulphur used is much
in excess of the amount required to form mercuric sulphide.</p>

<p>Second Step.&mdash;The black powder obtained in the first step is placed in a
semi-hemispherical iron pan, built in with brick, and having a fireplace
beneath, covered over with broken pieces of porcelain. These are built
up in a loose porous manner, so as to fill another semi-hemispherical
iron pan, which is then placed over the fixed one and securely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> luted
with clay, a large stone being placed on the top of it to assist in
keeping it in its place. The fire is then lighted and kept up for
sixteen hours. The whole is then allowed to cool. When the top pan is
removed, the vermilion, together with the greater part of the broken
porcelain, is attached to it in a coherent mass, which is easily
separated into its component parts. The surfaces of the vermilion which
were attached to the porcelain have a brownish red and polished
appearance, the broken surfaces being somewhat brighter and crystalline.</p>

<p>Third Step.&mdash;The sublimed mass obtained in the second step is pounded in
a mortar to a coarse powder, and then ground with water between two
stones, somewhat after the manner of grinding corn. The resulting
semi-fluid mass is transferred to large vats of water and allowed to
settle, the supernatant water is removed, and the sediment is dried at a
gentle heat; when dried, it is again powdered, passed through a sieve,
and is then fit for the market.&mdash;<i>Proc. Pharm. Soc.</i></p>

<p>(4) Firmenich describes a process which he declares gives better results
in the beauty of colour than any other. It consists in using sulphide of
potassium, which must be in a state of great purity. Of the various
methods for preparing potassium sulphide, Firmenich rejects those in
which caustic potash lye is boiled with excess of flowers of sulphur, on
account of the simultaneous formation of a hyposulphite or sulphate of
potash, which interferes in the preparation of the vermilion.</p>

<p>The process adopted by Firmenich for making pure potassium sulphide is
to reduce sulphate of potash by heating with charcoal, and subsequently
saturating the lye with sulphur to the necessary degree.</p>

<p>Usually about 20 parts by weight of potassium sulphate and 6 parts by
weight of charcoal are reduced to very fine powder and thoroughly
incorporated. Placed in a Hessian crucible, the mass is covered, luted,
and strongly heated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> As considerable ebullition takes place the
crucible should be of such a size that the charge only occupies
two-thirds of its capacity. After fusion is complete, the mass, which is
now potassium sulphide, is allowed to cool; it presents a reddish-brown
crystalline appearance, and is very hygroscopic. It is put into a
cast-iron pan, with addition of soft water in the proportion of 7 parts
of water to every 2 parts of the potassium sulphide; after boiling, it
is filtered and on cooling, the undecomposed sulphate of potash collects
in crystals attached to the sides of the pan.</p>

<p>The thus purified lye is boiled a second time with flowers of sulphur,
added in small doses until saturation is indicated by bubbling and
effervescence. The simple (monosulphide) potassium sulphide in this
manner takes up four additional atoms of sulphur, and becomes the
pentasulphide.</p>

<p>The preparation of the vermilion then proceeds in the following
manner:&mdash;Into a series of large flasks are put 11 lb. of mercury, 5 lb.
of the potassium sulphide lye, and 2¼ lb. of sulphur. The contents are
subjected to a moderate heat, and the flasks are then agitated in a
curious manner by arranging them in pairs in baskets suspended from
strings, over a straw mattress, on which the baskets bump each time they
descend.</p>

<p>Occasionally the flasks are turned about, and after about two hours of
this agitation they commence to grow hot, and the contents assume a
greenish-brown colour. The lye is robbed of its sulphur by the mercury,
and replenishes itself from the excess added.</p>

<p>Complete combination of the mercury and sulphur is accomplished in about
three and a half hours, when the colour of the mass becomes dark brown.
The next step is to cool the compound, an operation which must proceed
very slowly, and should occupy about five hours.</p>

<p>Development of the colour is effected by heat, for which purpose the
flasks are placed in a stove room or water bath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> and subjected to a
temperature which does not fluctuate beyond 113° and 122° F., under the
influence of which the red colour appears. The greatest care is
necessary in this heating process, as it determines the success or
failure of the colour. It lasts several days, during which the flasks
should be shaken three or four times daily.</p>

<p>In order to separate the vermilion from the excess of sulphur, water is
added to the contents of each bottle, and, after thorough shaking, the
whole is turned out into a filter. The clear liquor escapes, and the
residual vermilion is mixed with caustic soda lye in stoneware jars, and
thus the remaining free sulphur is dissolved out. Subsequently the lye
is poured off as completely as possible, and the deposit is repeatedly
washed, first by decantation and finally on a filter. The whole
operation of filtering and washing cannot be completed in less than two
or three days. When this is finished, the drying must be carried on at a
very low temperature, till the vermilion can readily be broken and is
dry to the touch, when it is put into iron basins and repeatedly
stirred, while the temperature is allowed to reach 143° F., but never
beyond that. The final desiccation occupies about five hours.</p>

<p>Vermilion made in this way is reputed more permanent and less costly
than by the usual methods.</p>

<p>(5) Dutch vermilion has a good name, and one method adopted in Holland
is as follows:&mdash;A mixture of 2 lb. of mercury and 1 lb. of sulphur is
thoroughly ground, and to 100 lb. of the mixture are added 2½ lb. of
minium or of granulated lead. About 2 cwt. of the compound is put into
each sublimation pot, which is duly heated. When the operation is
finished, the pots are allowed to cool for eighteen to twenty hours,
when they are broken, and their contents are ground in a mill. The lead
remains as a sulphide in the bottom of the pots.</p>

<p>(6) A modification of the Dutch method consists in making an intimate
mixture of 54 lb. of mercury squeezed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> through chamois leather and 7½
lb. of flowers of sulphur, which is then moderately heated on a shallow
iron dish, and the resulting black sulphide (“ethiops”) is coarsely
broken, ground, and kept in pots. To convert the ethiops into vermilion,
the former is put into large clay crucibles in a furnace, and heated to
dark-redness, whereupon the mass takes fire. As soon as the flame has
subsided, the crucibles are covered with a close-fitting iron plate, and
the firing is continued for thirty-six hours. The mass is stirred every
half-hour with an iron rod, and fresh additions of ethiops are made at
four or five hours’ intervals. The vermilion is sublimed, and condenses
on the cool portion of the interior of the crucibles, whence it is
collected by breaking the crucibles when cold, and is finally ground and
levigated.</p>

<p>(7) Kirchoff’s method requires special care, and consists in grinding
300 lb. of mercury with 68 lb. of flowers of sulphur in a mortar, the
sulphur being first moistened with a few drops of caustic potash. The
resulting black sulphide of mercury is added to 160 lb. of caustic
potash dissolved in very little water, and the whole is heated for half
an hour on a sand bath, with occasional addition of water to make up for
loss by evaporation. Gradually the mass, under constant agitation,
becomes brown and gelatinous, and finally red. Thereupon it is carried
to the stove room and still agitated at intervals. After several
washings it is drained, and dried very gently.</p>

<p>(8) Weshle mixes finely powdered cinnabar with 1 per cent. of antimony
sulphide, and boils the mixture several times with three parts of
potassium sulphide in a cast-iron pot. The precipitate is water-washed,
digested with hydrochloric acid, washed again, and finally dried.</p>

<p>(9) Jacquelin takes 90 lb. of mercury, 30 of sulphur, 30 of water, and
20 of hydrated potash; the mercury and sulphur are put into a shallow
cast-iron dish, dipping into cold water, and the potash solution is
added by degrees while the mass is kept in agitation. Then the mixture
is heated for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> hour at 176° F., the evaporated water being
replenished. The vermilion is washed in an excess of boiling water, and
again several times in cold water, and finally filtered and dried.</p>

<b>WHITES.</b></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">In</span> the whole range of pigments there is no more important class than
those to be described in this chapter. Not only are the white pigments
largely employed for the sake of their distinctive colour, but they are
probably even more extensively applied as a basis of other pigments,
both as an ingredient in the composition of the other coloured paints
and for ground coats where the final coat is to be of a delicate shade.
They are among the cheapest and most permanent pigments, and possess as
a whole remarkably good covering powers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baryta White.</span>&mdash;Barytes or sulphate of baryta, the most important of the
salts of barium, is found native in large quantities, forming the
species of mineral termed barites or barytes, and commonly known as
heavy-spar, on account of its weight (sp. gr. from 4·3 to 4·7). It is
found in Derbyshire and Shropshire, and often occurs in fine tabular
crystals. The massive variety found in the mountain limestone of the
above counties is sometimes called “cawk”; it is more frequently found
in white or reddish-white masses. In Saxony it occurs as the mineral
<i>stangen-spath</i>, in a columnar form; and at Bologna, a nodular variety
is found, called Bologna stone, which is notable for its phosphorescent
powers when heated.</p>

<p>The pure salt may be prepared artificially for use as a pigment, by
adding dilute sulphuric acid to a solution of chloride of baryta, when a
white precipitate is formed; this is well washed and dried. It is a
heavy, white powder, insoluble in water and nearly insoluble in all
other menstrua. It may also be prepared by heating the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> mineral,
grinding it to powder, and well washing it, first in dilute sulphuric
acid, in order to remove any traces of iron, and afterwards in water;
the white powder is afterwards thoroughly dried. This process is
employed at several works in the neighbourhood of Matlock Bath, in
Derbyshire, but much larger quantities could be produced in different
parts of the country if the demand for the article rendered its
production more profitable. The principal use of sulphate of baryta is
to adulterate white lead, and to form the pigment known as <i>blanc fixe</i>,
or permanent white. For these purposes, the native mineral, ground and
washed as described above, is commonly employed.</p>

<p>Improvements in machinery and in the process of treating natural barytes
have overcome many of the objections which formerly existed to its
utilisation, and considerable attention is now being given to the
localities in the United States where it is found. The mineral, in order
to be available for the uses to which it is put, must be fairly free
from quartz grains, the stain of iron rust, and other impurities. If the
barytes is stained to any extent, it is practically valueless, as a good
white colour is essential to its usefulness. Quartz grains or other hard
substances with which it is apt to be associated injure the machinery in
grinding. The purest barytes so far produced in America comes from
Missouri, though a very fair grade is now being mined in considerable
quantities in Virginia.</p>

<p>The returns from all producers of crude varieties show a product in the
United States, for 1889, of 21,640 short tons, valued at 106,313 dols.,

<p><span class="smcap">China Clay.</span>&mdash;This substance is also known as kaolin, porcelain clay, and
Cornish clay. It arises from the natural decomposition of felspar in
soft disintegrating granite, gneiss, and porphyry, the rocks which are
rich in soda-felspar yielding it most abundantly. The main supplies of
this country are derived from Cornwall and Devon; in continental Europe,
beds of good quality exist in France, Bavaria, Saxony, Prussia, Bohemia,
Bornholm island, and Hungary; in China, it is very plentiful; and in the
United States, it occurs in many localities.</p>

<p>The approximate composition of china clay may be stated as silica, 47·2;
alumina, 39·1; water, 13·7 per cent. Often a little iron, lime, and
potash or soda are left in the prepared article by the imperfection of
the cleansing process. The most important characters are colour,
plasticity, and a capacity for hardening under the influence of heat.</p>

<p>The china-clay industry of Cornwall and Devon has been admirably
described by J. H. Collins, F.G.S., in a paper recently read before the
Society of Arts.</p>

<p><i>Occurrence.</i>&mdash;The natural clay rock is almost always covered with a
thick layer of stones, sand, or impure and discoloured clay, known as
“overburden.” This capping often much resembles glacial drift; but it
never contains any scratched or glaciated stones, or travelled blocks.
It varies in thickness from 3 feet to 40 feet, and must, of course, be
removed before the clay can be wrought. The clay rock, being a
decomposed granite, consists of china-clay, irregular crystals of
quartz, and flakes of mica, with sometimes a little schorl and
undecomposed felspar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Extraction and Preparation.</i>&mdash;The following descriptions apply, with
more or less accuracy, to a majority of the larger works of the present
day, turning out from 2500 to 8000 tons of clay each, yearly. Two
somewhat different methods are employed, according to the situation of
the “bed” of clay in relation to the surface contour of the immediate
neighbourhood. The most general case is that in which the clay has to be
raised from a veritable pit, the bottom of which is lower than the
ground on all sides. The exact situation of the clay is first determined
by systematic “pitting,” to a depth of several fathoms, or occasionally
by boring. A shaft is then sunk either in the clay itself, or,
preferably, in the granite close to the clay. From the bottom of this
shaft, a level is driven out under that part of the clay which it is
intended to work first, and a “rise” is put up to the surface, which
should, by this time, be partially cleared of its overburden. A common
depth for such a shaft will be from ten to twelve fathoms. As soon as
the rise is completed to surface, a “button-hole” launder is placed in
it, and the remainder of the rise is again filled up with clay. In the
meantime, a column of pumps has been placed in the shaft, with an engine
to work them, unless water-power is obtainable.</p>

<p>For water, many works are almost entirely dependent upon that met with
in sinking the shaft and in driving levels; but, of course, this may be,
and is, eked out by catching the rain-water in reservoirs, and by making
use of such small streams as may happen to be available. A small
constant supply is sufficient even for a large work, as it is used over
and over again. The operation is begun by digging a small pit in the
clay, around the upper end of the button-hole launder, and running a
stream of water over the exposed clay, or “stope,” which is broken up
with picks. A very large quantity of sand is constantly disturbed, and
as constantly shovelled out of the way, while the water, holding the
clay and finer impurities in suspension, runs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> down the launder, along
the level, and into the bottom of the shaft, from whence it is pumped up
by the engine or water-wheel.</p>

<p>As the excavation becomes larger and deeper, more overburden is removed,
and the upper portions of the launder are taken away, until at last the
stopes reach the level, when the launder is, of course, no longer
required. At first, the sand is thrown out by one or two “throws,” but
very soon it becomes necessary to put in an inclined road, for pulling
up the sand in waggons; these are worked by a horse-whim, or by winding
gear attached to the engine or water-wheel. As there are from three to
eight tons of sand to each ton of clay, its removal in the cheapest
possible manner is a matter of great importance. Any veins or lodes of
stone, or discoloured portions of clay, are raised from the “bottoms” in
the same way as the sand. The stream of water, holding in suspension
clay, fine sand, and mica, is, in well-arranged works, lifted at once
high enough to allow of all subsequent operations being carried out by
the aid of gravity.</p>

<p>The stream is first led into one or two long channels, the sides of
which are built of rough stone. In these channels, called “drags,” the
current suffers a partial check, and the fine sand and rougher particles
of mica are deposited. From these drags, the stream passes on into other
channels, much resembling them, but of greater number, so as to divide
the stream still further. This second series of channels, known as
“micas,” are often built of wood, but sometimes of stone. They differ in
no essential respect from the drags, but are more carefully constructed
and better looked after, and, as the stream is greatly divided and very
gentle, the fine mica is deposited in them. The micas are often about 11
inches wide, ten or a dozen in number, and 100 feet or more long.
Provision is made, by underground channels and plug holes, for the
periodical cleansing of the drags and micas. This may have to be done
twice a day, but generally only once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The deposit in the drags is worthless at present, and is always thrown
away; but that from the micas is often saved, and sold as inferior or
“mica” clay. The refined stream of clay then passes on to the “pits,”
which are circular, 30 to 40 feet diameter and 7 to 10 feet deep. These
pits are built of rough masonry, and have an outlet at the bottom,
opposite the point at which the stream of clay-water is admitted. This
outlet is stopped by a gate or “hatch,” or by a plug, and is kept closed
until the pit is full of clay. In each outlet, however, is fixed an
upright launder some 4 inches square, provided with “pin-holes” and
wooden pins set close together. As the stream of clay enters on one
side, it is constantly depositing its burden, and the water is as
constantly drawn off nearly or quite clear from the pin holes, the pins
being put higher and higher as the clay rises in the pit. The effluent
water is conducted directly to small storage reservoirs, and thence over
the clay stopes, whence it does its work over again.</p>

<p>When the stream of clay-water enters the pits, it contains from 1½ to 3
per cent. of clay; and what is called a good washing stream will carry
about one ton of clay an hour. When the pit is full, the “hatch” is
drawn, and the clay is “landed” into the tank. The upper portion is
sufficiently fluid to run in of itself; but that near the bottom has to
be helped out by men using “shivers” of wood or iron, which resemble
large hoes; they are assisted by a small stream of water. The tanks are
commonly, but not always, rectangular, built of stone, and paved with
stone at bottom, often 60 feet by 30 feet by 6 feet or larger. Once in
the tank, the clay is left to settle, until it has the consistency of
cream cheese, the water being drawn off from time to time; it is then
ready to be trammed into the “dry.”</p>

<p>The “dry” is a large building erected in immediate proximity to the
tanks. It is always composed of two parts, the dry proper and the
“linhay.” The floor or “pan” of the dry is composed of fire-clay tiles
18 inches square, 5 or 6 inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> thick at the fire end, and gradually
thinning off to 2 or 2½ inches at the stack end. The flues are built of
fire-brick, about 15 inches wide, 2 feet deep at the fire end, and 9
inches deep at the stack end. Each flue should be supplied with a
damper. The furnaces are built in and arched over with best fire-brick;
the fire bars run longitudinally, and are about 6 feet long. The grate
surface is about 2 feet 6 inches wide in front, and 4 feet 6 inches to 6
feet at back, according as each furnace supplies three or four flues.</p>

<p>The clay, brought in from the tanks in tram-waggons holding about half a
ton, is tipped on to the tiles, and spread in a layer from 9 inches
thick at the fire end to 6 inches thick at the stack end. The fire end
is loaded and cleared every day; the other end perhaps twice or thrice a
week, according to the length of the dry, thickness of tiles, perfection
of draught, &amp;c. An average size for a first-class dry is perhaps 15 feet
wide and 120 feet long; but some have been constructed considerably
larger than this. The pan of the dry should be 6 or 8 feet above the
linhay whenever possible, so as to afford storage space for the dry
clay, without expending labour in piling. The tiles should be as porous
as possible, for very much more water passes through the tiles and into
the flues than is driven upwards in the state of steam. The temperature
should never be allowed to rise so high that the workmen cannot walk on
the tiles, otherwise the clay may become baked and damaged.</p>

<p>In cases where there are no means of artificial drying, as at some
old-fashioned works, the thick clay is at once transferred from the
original settling pit to shallow depressions in the ground, called
“pans.” Ten or twelve of these, each holding from 40 to 50 tons, should
be provided for each settling pit; they measure from 20 to 40 feet
square, and 2 feet deep, and are enclosed by granite walls, the
interstices of which are rendered impervious by plugging with moss. The
clay, filling two-thirds of their depth, is here left ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>posed to the
sun and wind, by which it is partially deprived of its moisture.</p>

<p>In order to complete its desiccation, the clay is removed from the pans
after three or four months’ exposure. A number of parallel incisions are
made lengthwise in the clay, by means of a knife attached to a long
handle; the strips are next divided transversely, by men with spades,
who throw the blocks on to a board, upon which they are borne by women
and children to the sandy drying yard, where, in fine summer weather,
they soon become dry. They are then collected, and piled away in sheds,
under a number of thatched gates or “reeders,” or are placed in some
sheltered position where air can circulate around them without their
becoming wet from rain.</p>

<p>When required, the blocks are scraped by women armed with hoes, before
being despatched from the works. The transport is often effected in
small casks, holding about half a ton. A few years since, a machine for
drying china-clay was invented by a mechanical engineer named Leopoldo
Henrion, of Sampierdacena, near Genoa. It is said that, by its use, the
operation can be effected in a few hours, at a relatively small cost.</p>

<p>Collins was first led to adopt his arrangement in consequence of the
formation of the ground; but he is inclined to recommend it in most
cases if practicable. Very large quantities of stone are required in the
dry pits, tanks, &amp;c. Very often this is got, in part or entirely, in the
process of excavating the pits, &amp;c.; but if it cannot be so obtained, a
very serious expense will be incurred, in some instances amounting to
several thousand pounds. The total cost of the works may even be doubled
from this cause, if stone has to be fetched from a distance of several
miles.</p>

<p>Two modes of building with rough stone are adopted; they are known as
“lime building,” and “dry stone walling.” The first needs no special
remark, but the second is very ingenious and very effectual. The wall is
built up double,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> with a batter of about ¾ inch or 1 inch to the foot.
Moss is placed between the joints of the wall, and the space between is
filled in with sharp sand, the refuse of that or some other clay works.
A small stream of water is then made to flow over the sand, which is
well beaten in with rammers, or by treading with the feet. This process
is continued, a foot at a time, till the wall reaches the required
height, when it is either paved with rough stones set on edge, or
turfed. A wall properly built, in the manner just described, is quite
impervious to moisture, and will stand for fifty years or more. It is,
where the proper kind of sand is abundant, much cheaper than lime
walling, and is always preferred for the walls of pits and tanks.</p>

<p>Where the bed of clay is situated on a hill-side, with plenty of space
below, a tunnel is driven in from the hill-side or from the valley to
the required depth, and a rise is put up as before. This rise is then
divided off into two parts. In the smaller, a button-hole launder is
placed as before, and packed around with clay; but the larger is left
open. A stream of water, obtained by pumping or otherwise, is made to
run over the stope, and down the button-hole launder. It then flows
along a launder placed in the bottom of the level, until it makes its
exit in the valley. It may then be purified, settled, and dried exactly
as already described&mdash;the works being laid out at a lower level than the
adit; or, if the clear water is wanted to flow over the stope, or it is,
for any reason, necessary to place the pits and tanks at a higher level
than the stopes, the water is pumped up after partial or complete
purification.</p>

<p>The main difference in this mode of working is that instead of pulling
the sand and rubbish up over an incline, it may be tipped down the pass
into waggons, run out through the level, and tipped over the hill-sides.
In cases where waste water is abundant, it may even be washed out at
night, thus saving the expense of tramming. Of course, when the workings
have reached their full depth, the rise and the launder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> are dispensed
with, and the adit level communicates directly with the “bottoms.” By
this mode of working a considerable economy may be effected, especially
when it is not necessary to pump the clay water for settling or
repeating.</p>

<p><i>Cost of Production.</i>&mdash;Where the conditions of production vary so
greatly, there must necessarily be great differences of cost; but, after
having been at some pains to determine the cost under average
conditions, Collins thinks the following figures and statements may be
relied upon. A work capable of producing say 4000 tons of clay yearly
will cost from 2500<i>l.</i> to 5000<i>l.</i> To get the clay in the linhay ready
for the market will cost about 9<i>s.</i> a ton, of which about 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
must be expended in fuel for pumping and drying, 1<i>s.</i> in removing
overburden, 1<i>s.</i> in removing sand, and 1<i>s.</i> for management and office
expenses, leaving 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> as the net labour cost of washing and
drying a ton of clay. To the 9<i>s.</i> net cost of clay must be added an
average of 3<i>s.</i> for royalties, 4<i>s.</i> for transit and placing on board
ship, and 1<i>s.</i> for agencies, commission, bad debts, and sundries,
making the average actual cost amount to 17<i>s.</i> Some favourably situated
works can no doubt save 2<i>s.</i> or even 3<i>s.</i> on this account; in others,
the cost may amount to 20<i>s.</i> or even 22<i>s.</i> As to the selling price,
this varies much more widely than the cost of production, ranging from
14<i>s.</i> to 35<i>s.</i> <i>f.o.b.</i> Clays sold at the lower rate are
unremunerative.</p>

<p><i>Nature and Utilisation of Waste Products.</i>&mdash;Besides the clay proper,
there are certain waste or pseudo-waste substances produced in very
large quantities. These are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Fine Mica.&mdash;This is deposited in the “micas”; a few years since it was
thrown away, or rather washed away, as is still the case in many works.
Sometimes, however, it is collected, dried in the manner of clay proper,
and sold to the makers of soft paper, paste-board, inferior pottery,
&amp;c., at a low price.</p>

<p>Coarse Mica.&mdash;This is invariably washed away, or thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> away, there
being at present no demand for it. It, however, contains a very
beautiful material, which might be applied to many ornamental purposes.</p>

<p>Sand.&mdash;This consists of broken quartz crystals, mostly white or pale
brownish; when washed clean, it is the finest building sand known, as
the angles are all sharp. Mixed with one-eighth of Portland cement, it
forms a concrete as hard as stone.</p>

<p>Discoloured Clay.&mdash;This has to be dug out from among the good white clay
in many places. It has been successfully used in the manufacture of
white bricks for building purposes. In some instances, a quantity of the
sand already mentioned is mixed with the refuse clay, and produces an
excellent fire-brick. The same material is used in the manufacture of
the tiles used as a floor for drying the clay. The manufacture of bricks
and tiles from this debris is a growth, it is believed, of the last
twelve years.</p>

<p>Overburden.&mdash;The upper part of this consists of soil, or “meat earth”;
this is usually removed and carefully preserved. Underneath is a hard,
often stony or sandy layer, which, in districts where tin is worked,
often contains enough tin to pay for washing. With this stony or sandy
layer, is usually a considerable thickness of discoloured clay suitable
for brick-making.</p>

<p>Branches.&mdash;These are stony veins which run through the clay stopes in
various directions. Sometimes they are quite worthless; but in a few
instances they are veritable tin lodes, and contain enough tin to pay
for stamping and dressing. Thus at Carclaze, near St. Austell, each 1000
tons of clay yields something like one ton of oxide of tin, and formerly
the proportion was much greater. The proportions of these waste
materials, as compared with the fine clay procured, are thus stated:&mdash;</p>

<p>For every 1 ton of fine clay there is removed&mdash;from 3 to 7 tons of sand,
average about 3½ tons; from 2 to 5 cwt. of coarse mica, average 3 cwt.;
from 1 to 3 cwt. of fine mica,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> average 2 cwt.; from 0 to 1 cwt. of
stones, average ¼ cwt.</p>

<p>A cubic fathom of clay rock, of average quality, will yield about 2½
tons of fine clay; and about half a fathom of overburden must be removed
to get it.</p>

<p><i>Suggested Improvements in Preparing.</i>&mdash;Collins thinks that there is
still much room for improvement in the preparation of china clay, but
that such must be a growth of time and circumstances. At the present
time, about one ton of water has to be driven off from each ton of clay
in the “dry,” and this uses at least 2 cwt. of coals on an average, and
costs from 8<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i> in labour. In a few modern drys, a small
economy in fuel has been effected, by lengthening the kiln; but in none
has it been brought so low as 1½ cwt. to the ton of clay.</p>

<p>Stocker, in 1862, suggested the use of filter beds, and also devised a
centrifugal dryer; but neither of these contrivances has come into use,
and the first would seem quite inapplicable on account of the extreme
fineness of the particles of clay, and the impermeability of even a thin
layer of that substance. Some economy might perhaps result from the use
of hydraulic filters of calico, such as are used in the potteries for
drying the slip; but it is very doubtful if any saving would be
effected, as the labour would be about the same, and, against the 2<i>s.</i>
a ton for fuel, would have to be placed the wear and tear of the calico.</p>

<p>In washing the clay from the stope, some benefit might accrue from the
use of a jet of water under a pressure of from 50 to 100 lb. per square
inch, as in the so-called hydraulic mining. This could only be applied
to stopes of even quality, where very little picking out of inferior
portions was required; but it would supersede the services of the
“breakers” on the stope, and greatly lessen the labour of the washers.
It is but rarely that a natural head of water is obtainable equal to the
required pressure; but where machinery is used for pumping, the
additional cost of pumping, say 250 gals. a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> minute to a height of 150
feet in a standpipe, would be very slight, as the extra power required
is little more than that of one horse.</p>

<p><i>Statistics.</i>&mdash;From statistics obtained from many sources, it is evident
that the production has very largely increased from 1809 to 1874&mdash;2919
tons against 226,309. In 1810, Trethosa (one of the largest works)
produced 300 tons per annum, and employed thirteen persons, viz. eight
in removing burden and raising (breaking) clay (at per fathom), three
washing, two attending ponds and packing. In 1874, one of the works near
St. Austell produced 9000 tons, employing about thirty men. Many works
produced 6000 tons, employing twenty men. The quantity sent annually
from Cornwall must average at least 150,000 tons. It goes not only to
Staffordshire, but also largely to France, Belgium, and other countries.
The extensive clay works recently opened in several departments of
Northern France have done much to curtail the export of Cornish clay to
that country, and the large deposits of the island of Bornholm have
lately been worked upon to supply the needs of Denmark, Sweden, and
Germany; while similar utilisation of native clays has been carried out
in America. Nevertheless, the growth of home industries which depend in
a measure upon this article will, doubtless, counteract the influence of
decreasing exports.</p>

<p><i>Artificial China Clay.</i>&mdash;The principal supplies of china clay are
obtained, as has been described, through the agency of natural
decomposing influences in granite rocks. In one instance, however, at
Betleek, County Fermanagh, it is procured by calcining the red
orthoclase granite of the district. The felspar is whitened by the
process, and the iron becomes separated in a metallic state, and is
removed by magnets.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Being virtually a hydrated silicate of alumina, china
clay is a remarkably stable pigment. Not only is it unaffected by
prolonged exposure to strong light and impure air, but is insoluble in
water, weak acids, and alkalies. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> is moreover very much lighter in
weight than any other white pigment, an advantage on the score of cost
when buying by weight. Its covering power in distemper work and as a
water colour is good; but the addition of oil reduces its capacity. The
best qualities are exceedingly fine in grain and pure in tint, but
inferior samples sometimes have their yellowness “corrected” by the
addition of a little ultramarine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Enamelled White.</span>&mdash;Another name for the finest kinds of baryta white, <a href="#Page_170">see
p. 170.</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">English White.</span>&mdash;A synonym for whiting, see <a href="#Page_246">p. 246</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gypsum.</span>&mdash;This very common and abundant mineral is a hydrated sulphate of
lime, occurring in several forms, of which only the opaque white variety
is useful as a pigment.</p>

<p>The native mineral is quarried, dressed, ground, and levigated, in all
which operations there is nothing special to be noted.</p>

<p>Whether obtained in this way, or prepared artificially, or formed as a
bye product in other industries, gypsum affords a permanent and neutral
white pigment, mixing well with oil or water, and possessing a covering
power which ranks between white lead and zinc white. It has a bluish
tint, but less so than ordinary white lead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kaolin.</span>&mdash;One of the names applied to china clay, see <a href="#Page_172">p. 172</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lead Whites, or White Leads.</span>&mdash;On the grounds of the quantity in which it
is produced and the extent to which it is applied, probably no pigment
can compare with white lead, including in that term the various white
pigments having lead as a basis.</p>

<p>In its commonest form white lead is lead carbonate. There are many ways
in which it is made commercially, all dependent upon certain chemical
reactions.</p>

<p>When a solution of normal plumbic acetate is attacked by carbonic acid,
no precipitate is produced. That normal solution is formed by the action
of acetic acid or hydric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> acetate upon oxide of lead. It consists of a
certain weight of lead to a certain weight of acid, which converts it
into the acetate. Carbonic acid has no power to separate out from it the
lead, and form carbonate of lead. But this acetate of lead has the power
of dissolving a considerable quantity of oxide of lead in addition to
that which was used in its first formation, and when this additional
quantity of oxide of lead is dissolved by the acetate, a substance is
formed which is termed a basic acetate, that means an acetate which
contains more of the base (the lead oxide) than the normal acetate
itself does. From such a solution we are able to precipitate, by means
of carbonic acid, a white substance, which white substance is a
carbonate of lead.</p>

<p>Thénard, a French chemist, proposed to make white lead in this way, but
it was found that although the colour was pure and good, yet the lead
had not sufficient body to satisfy the wishes of artists and painters.
White lead has been made for years past according to what is called the
Dutch method. Lead is cast into plates, and these plates, in some
factories, are rolled into coils. These coils then are immersed in
earthen pots; the pots are placed in a row, and a small quantity of
vinegar is put into each pot. On the top of one row of pots a board is
placed, and then other pots above, and so a stack is made. Between the
interstices of the pots is put spent tan, or some other substance which
by oxidation will evolve heat, and also carbonic acid gas. Now the heat
which is evolved in oxidation of the spent tan is useful in volatilising
the acid from the vinegar, and in the presence of this acetate the
oxygen of the air oxidises the lead. The oxide of lead is dissolved by
the acid, and the normal acetate of lead is formed. More oxide is
produced, and this is dissolved by the normal acetate, and then you have
basic acetate.</p>

<p>When substances containing carbon are oxidised, carbonic acid is the
product of the oxidation when the oxygen is in excess, as in this
particular case. Carbonic acid is then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> formed by the oxidation of the
spent tan. The carbonic acid then unites with the oxide of lead which
was dissolved in the normal acetate, and a thin film of lead carbonate
is formed. These thin films go on forming in succession, until at last
nearly the whole of the lead is converted into carbonate, which retains
the shape of the original lead. In some cases, gratings of lead are
used. When the lead is converted into carbonate, it is ground in water
and reduced to a fine powder, and is then made up into the sort of
pigments required, either with water or with oil. This is, or rather
was, an operation attended with considerable danger to the workmen, who
were subjected to what is termed lead-poisoning, to which,
unfortunately, many painters, from want of cleanly habits, are subject
now.</p>

<p><i>Dutch Process.</i>&mdash;In the words of Mr. Carter Bell, who has read a most
interesting paper on the subject before the Society of Chemical
Industry, the manufacture of white lead is a most ancient proceeding,
and has been pursued with but little variation in the mode of
manufacture for some hundreds of years. The Dutch seem to have been the
originators of this method of making white lead, which is now so largely
conducted in this and other countries.</p>

<p>In this process metallic lead is piled in stacks, and submitted to the
action of acetic acid, watery vapour, air, and carbonic acid for some
time, by which means the metallic lead becomes gradually converted into
white lead.</p>

<p>This method is called the “stack” or Dutch process.</p>

<p>The construction of a stack is a very simple and rude operation. Layers
of dung or tan, or a mixture of the two, are so arranged as to imbed a
large number of earthenware pots, each containing some acetic acid.
These pots are about 4 or 5 inches in diameter, and about 7 or 8 inches
high; a coil of lead is placed in each pot, and buckles or gratings of
lead supported on oaken bearers are laid across and on top of the pots;
boards are laid to cover the whole, and form a floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>The stack is composed of a number of such layers of pots, bearers, and
buckles or gratings, raised one upon another.</p>

<p>A stack chamber is a brick enclosure 10 or 12 feet square, and 20 or 25
feet high; such a chamber will contain about 70 tons of lead when
stacked and piled. In a white lead factory several of these chambers are
built side by side, and when they are in full operation a set of
chambers will contain as much as 700 or 1000 tons of lead.</p>

<p>Only the purest kind of lead will be suitable for conversion in this
stack process of making white lead, the common varieties being
inadmissible. Messrs. Pontifex and Wood have furnished the following
analyses of lead used for white lead making.</p>

<p>The presence of silver, copper and iron in the lead would damage the
colour of the white lead resulting, and other admixtures retard or
prevent the progress of conversion.</p>

<p>In olden times horse dung was the only imbedding material used in the
stack arrangement. This material when heated evolves gases which
seriously interfere with the colour of the resulting corrosion. Dung has
been almost superseded in this country by tanners’ refuse; in Belgium
dung is yet employed, and in some places a mixture of dung and tan.</p>

<p>Where dung is used, the process of corrosion of the lead goes on more
quickly than when tan alone is employed, but the use of tan offers great
advantages, especially this one: that it does not give off gases that
damage the white lead.</p>

<p>The operations of charging and discharging these chambers are
principally the work of women, and are most laborious and fatiguing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>In emptying the chambers and stripping the stacks, the women are fully
exposed to the heated gases which are yielded by the decomposing tan,
and the heated and corroded lead. These gases, in themselves most
injurious to health, are not to be compared in this respect to the dust
which pervades the air and fills the chamber in which these women work.</p>

<p>When a stack is charged, the chamber containing it is enclosed. The tan
or dung within soon commences heating, and the heat soon causes the
acetic acid in the pots, and the water in the tan or dung, to rise in
vapour and penetrate the stack. Air is admitted to the stack through
openings left for that purpose, and carbonic acid is evolved from the
heated decomposing tan or dung, and this gas also penetrates the stack,
and the process of converting blue lead into the white lead gradually
proceeds, and the blue metal becomes corroded and incrusted with a white
crust or covering.</p>

<p>As to the exact chemical changes and combinations proceeding in the
working of a stack, differences of opinion exist, but we may fairly
conclude that the process resolves itself into this&mdash;first, the
formation of sub-acetate of lead, which, decomposed by the agency of the
carbonic acid gas, becomes reduced to the condition of normal acetate by
loss of a portion of its basic oxide of lead. The reduced sub-acetate
then again takes up an additional molecule of oxide of lead, and is
re-converted into its original subsalt state, to be again attacked and
reduced by the carbonic acid gas, and so on continually during the
working of the stack. It will be evident that the “nascent” state of the
various substances disengaged during the chemical changes which are
proceeding in the stack is an important factor in this process, and must
be taken into account in considering the philosophy of the operation.</p>

<p>It will also be evident that the mode of proceeding in white lead making
by the stack process is most crude and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> clumsy, and a most uncertain
method, one governed by rule of thumb, and, by no element of certainty
or science. White lead makers, as a rule, know nothing of the chemistry
of their subject. This absence of chemical knowledge of the subject, by
those who are engaged in this manufacture, may explain the curious
circumstance that for hundreds of years this industry has been pursued
in the same old-fashioned and uncertain way, and the stack, or Dutch
process, still holds its ground and displays little or no advance in
knowledge or improvements in its method of proceeding, even in the
present age of precision in almost every branch of manufacture. The
uncertainty of the stack process is shown most clearly in this: That
stacks may work and some do not work. In the latter case all the time
and labour spent in forming the stacks, and all the acid they contained,
is lost.</p>

<p>No amount of foresight will avail to determine beforehand which stack
shall accomplish the conversion of its contained metallic lead, and
which will not.</p>

<p>The stacks are generally allowed to remain in operation, after they are
charged, three or four months; in this time it is presumed all
profitable action in the stack has ceased. The temperature of the stack,
which had risen gradually from the normal temperature to 100° or 150°
F., will have gradually fallen, and this falling temperature is the
indication that the corrosion of the lead in the stack has terminated.</p>

<p>After the three months’ action of the stacks, they are stripped and
pulled to pieces. Some will be found to be done better than others, and
one part of the same stack will be done more perfectly than another. The
coating on the lead will also differ; some will be smooth, regular, and
equal in formation, some will be rough and blistered, and far from
uniform. The rough blistered casting is rejected as unfit for white lead
making: the workmen call it “dross.” The smooth laminated coating is the
one preserved for the after manufacture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a curious fact connected with the consideration of the total want
of educated guidance in these matters that prevails, that in all
factories of this description some chambers are noted as always working
well, and others are equally well known to always do their work the
reverse of well. No one knows why! No one stays to seek the reason. The
factory way goes on filling and emptying these white lead chambers
whether the stacks be working well or no.</p>

<p>The incrustation that is most esteemed by the manufacturers of white
lead in this old-fashioned style is a hard, china-like material, formed
of thin deposits, layer upon layer, in a slow, continuous, regular way.
It is at once conceivable that in the rough-and-ready manner of stack
manufacture most irregular action must proceed.</p>

<p>It would be almost impossible for the contents of the pile or stack to
be submitted to the same action of the gases throughout. Some parts of
the stack and its contents will be under more favourable conditions than
others, hence the reason why, in practice, it is invariably found that
some stacks, and some parts of a stack, work better than others. Under
the microscope, this good crust of white lead, the proper incrustation
from which to prepare white lead, will be readily seen to consist of
very thin coatings or layers of white lead, which have been slowly
formed on the metallic lead and piled one upon another to the thickness
of an eighth or a quarter of an inch. This formation constitutes the
hard, china-like substance, which alone possesses the chemical
constitution and the properties to form good white lead paint.</p>

<p>White lead makers, recognising this peculiar incrustation as the only
one capable of fulfilling their desired purpose of making good white
lead paint, do not even recognise any other as of any service for that
purpose, be it good or bad. Such a material, if obtained, however good,
would be outside their experience and beyond their philosophy. After the
stacks have been stripped, the gratings or buckles with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> adhering
coating of white lead are moistened with water and are passed through
crushing rollers to separate the unconverted lead; then the crust which
has been detached is ground under heavy edge runners with water.</p>

<p>This detached crust of white lead will vary much in colour: it will be
white in some parts, yellowish or greyish in others. These
discolorations arise from various causes, but they are principally
caused by the contact of the moist wood and tan. The white lead is now a
rough crushed material, very hard, and requiring to be ground to the
finest powder. It contains, also, small fragments of blue lead which
have passed the crushing rolls, and a quantity of acetate of lead. The
presence of acetate of lead is always found in larger or smaller
quantities, which vary with every operation, and which invariably
accompany white lead produced in the stack.</p>

<p>To remove discolorations&mdash;to separate the fragments of metal and to
dissolve out the acetate salt&mdash;much water and washing are employed. The
material is ground with water under the heavy edge runner stones, it
then proceeds to a series of horizontal mills, each succeeding mill set
closer than its fellow, and is further and further ground to fineness
with water. From these mills it runs as a milky liquid to a series of
settling tanks, where it is allowed to subside, and the clear fluid is
run off to waste, or into tanks to be used over again. This waste water
will now contain the colouring matter removed from the incrustation, and
the principal portion of the acetate of lead which the incrustation
previously contained, and any other soluble matters removed from the
washed and ground material. The small fragments of lead which passed the
crushing roll and edge runner mills will have been previously removed by
subsidence in water.</p>

<p>The white lead deposited in the tanks is in some factories ladled out
into skips and agitated by a “dolly,” which further enables the heavy
powder to get free from the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> in which it is entangled. The moist
powder is next placed on trays or dishes, and is conveyed to the stove
or drying chamber. Women always perform this work.</p>

<p>The drying or stoving room is a large enclosed space heated by a
“cockle” arrangement; rough scaffoldings are erected within this
chamber, on which women mount to stow the trays on shelves fitted for
the purpose. The trays and their contents remain in the heated
atmosphere of this chamber for two or three weeks, by which time they
become dry and ready for removal, to be packed in lumps for certain
markets, or ground to dry powder and packed in barrels for others.</p>

<p>Women are employed to fill and also to empty the drying or stoving
chamber, and during this work they are fully exposed to its
contaminating atmosphere. Hot and dry, and charged with fine dusty
particles of white lead, it becomes a dangerous trap, and contaminates
the blood of those engaged with its deadly poison. It is in this part of
the manufacture that the principal damage to health occurs. This is the
most laborious work; heat makes it very fatiguing, the atmosphere within
this chamber being always much above the exterior air.</p>

<p>Recent Government regulations have sought to curtail these and other
evils in this manufacture. Women engaged in these stoves are ordered to
wear overclothing, headdress and respirators. The general experience of
their practice, notwithstanding Government regulations, is this; that
they cannot work in them with ease and convenience, and more often wear
the respirator around their necks than in front of nose and mouth. The
excessive mortality in women who work in these stacks and stoving houses
scarcely requires assertion. Few, even of those who employ them, know
the extent of the deadly operation. Recently, medical men have made
public that cases are within their knowledge of children born already
contaminated with lead poison. Woman labour should surely be restricted
by Government enactments in all such deadly occupations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>We may sum up the whole matter as regards white lead making by the stack
or Dutch method in a few brief words: It is a most tedious and uncertain
operation; it is a most dangerous occupation for all concerned; it is
founded upon no true principles of any kind; and of science its whole
course is ignorant. White lead making is ruled by a “happy-go-lucky”
philosophy. The representatives of this manufacture are completely
ignorant of the scientific details relating to it, and hence we may not
be surprised to find amongst them an enormous amount of ignorance and
prejudice.</p>

<p>Good white lead will not differ materially in its composition by
whatever process it may be made, but it may differ seriously in its
physical character, and in its fitness to produce a substance adapted to
the uses to which white lead paint is applied. Good white lead is a
compound which contains hydrate and carbonate of the metal, in the
proportions either of one molecule of hydrate of lead combined with two
of carbonate, or is made up of one molecule of hydrate with three of
carbonate of lead.</p>

<p>If we consider the first compound roughly</p>

<p class="c">
PbH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,2Pb CO<sub>3</sub><br />
</p>

<p class="nind">white lead will be made up of one part of hydrate and two parts of
carbonate of lead.</p>

<p>The second compound roughly estimated</p>

<p class="c">
Pb H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,3Pb CO<sub>3</sub><br />
</p>

<p class="nind">will be one part of hydrate, combined with three parts of carbonate or
lead. The latter will be in the proportion of 75 per cent, of carbonate
and 25 per cent, of hydrate of lead, and this represents the composition
which has been assigned to good white lead by those most acquainted with
the subject. The amount of hydrate contained in white lead should never
exceed the proportion above named of 25 per cent., nor should its amount
be much below the 25 per cent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The hydrate contained in the substance serves to unite with the oil in
the paint; it forms therewith a drying white and elastic varnish which
embraces and holds the particles of white carbonate and prevents their
subsidence and separation in the paint. There is a chemical action of a
much more intimate character between the components of good white lead
when mixed with oil which neither of the constituents of this compound
can alone produce.</p>

<p>For instance, hydrate of lead and linseed oil produce a varnish-like
substance, semi-transparent and of no covering capability.</p>

<p>Carbonate of lead and linseed oil produce a compound which is opaque,
but has no body or covering power, and in which the white solid
carbonate is held in feeble mechanical suspension.</p>

<p>Neither of them constitutes a paint, but when together as white lead
they are mixed with oil, combination takes place, and serviceable paint
of good body and covering power and enduring quality is produced. Good
white lead is a dense, perfectly amorphous powder of perfect whiteness,
possessed of great body and covering power when combined with oil. When
mixed with linseed oil and used as paint it rapidly dries in the air and
assumes a varnish-like, glossy, hard surface, and is capable when once
dry of resisting the action of air and water for any length of time. It
does not weep when laid on a surface with a brush, that is, the oil does
not separate from the solid material of the paint.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to produce white lead quickly and cheaply by
precipitating processes, but in all such methods the resulting compound
is deficient in certain special qualities absolutely necessary to white
lead proper and to its uses. The precipitated white lead is always of a
crystalline structure, and crystalline lead can never furnish a good
body paint&mdash;no amount of pulverising and grinding of this crystalline
material will correct this defect in its nature, and deprive it of its
crystalline form.</p>

<p>“Once a crystal always a crystal” has an especial applica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>tion to this
point of our philosophy. Pulverising a crystal will not alter its
structure, but simply reduces the size of the crystals. Crystals of
white lead are unable to effect the necessary combination with the oil
and form the true varnish which white amorphous lead so readily
produces. Paint made with the precipitated white lead lacks body and
covering power, and this because of the absence of this chemical union
with the oil.</p>

<p>The manufacture of white lead by process of precipitation, even were the
resulting preparation suitable, does not correct the evils of the
present method by Dutch or stack process of making white lead.</p>

<p>A solution of lead may be precipitated in a few minutes, but it cannot
be made so quickly. The white lead, after its precipitation, has to be
filtered or separated, washed and dried, and ground to powder, which
processes cannot occupy less time than a few weeks for completion.</p>

<p>Precipitated white lead has been made in France and Germany for some
years, and it is now manufactured in those countries. It is now made in
England by one patent process, but the product lacks certain qualities,
and is consequently still open to the objections already noted.</p>

<p>Substitutes for white lead of a non-poisonous nature, or of such a
nature as not to produce such deadly effects in their preparation or use
as white lead does, have been proposed; their introduction has not,
however, been a great success. A mixture of sulphate, sulphide and oxide
of zinc is a patent white made by subliming galena in an oxidising
furnace or hearth. This compound lacks body.</p>

<p>All of these so-called substitutes are very inferior to white lead, not
only as to quality but as to cost. They cannot compete with white lead.
A committee of enquiry on these substitutes for white lead, reporting
the result of their enquiry and examination, stated that they found that
these were mostly prepared with varnishes before they were sold for use,
and that in most instances they were mixed with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span> large quantity of
driers, and that the drier invariably was a compound of lead.</p>

<p>The principal consumption of white lead is for paint; to produce this
paint it is ground with oil in varying proportions, about 8 to 15 per
cent. This produces the ordinary white lead in oil, and is worth from
19<i>l.</i> to 20<i>l.</i> a ton, but often more than this amount.</p>

<p>Dry powdered white lead is chiefly made for and used by grinders and
mixers, who combine with it a variety of other cheaper materials&mdash;chalk,
clay, sulphate of lime, and sulphate of baryta, but principal use is
made of chalk and barytes. These are mixed with the white lead, and then
the mixture is ground with oil and formed into paint, sold under various
names according to quality: thus&mdash;guaranteed white lead, firsts,
seconds, thirds, and fourths, the proportion of white lead diminishing,
and that of the adulterant increasing, as we descend from the pure
material. Guaranteed and best white lead is not pure, and does not mean
pure white lead. Pure white lead can be purchased at some makers, but
its price, if pure, can never fall below 19<i>l.</i> or 20<i>l.</i> per ton.</p>

<p>To sophisticate white lead, and produce the various inferiors named, dry
powdered white lead is needed as a starting point, and for this purpose
principally arises the necessity for its production. If ground in oil
the adulterants cannot be properly incorporated with it. Dry white lead
is used for nothing else that could ever give rise to any great demand
for it. We have already observed that the production of this dry and
powdered white lead is the most dangerous proceeding connected with this
industry. Grinding in oil is unattended with any important consequence
to the health and comfort of those employed. A serious drawback to the
“stack” production, the china-like incrustation to which reference has
already been made, is that it requires crushing, grinding, washing, and
drying, and a second course of dry grinding after it is dried&mdash;the most
objectionable step in its preparation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Could the corrosion of the blue lead be effected in such a way as to
prevent any discoloration of the material by the tan and wood&mdash;could the
corrosion be so produced as to be easily separated from the buckle or
grating on which it has formed&mdash;could this separation be so effected as
to prevent the breaking up of the lead skeleton, and the presence of
small pieces of metal in the detached crust of white lead, two principal
reasons for washing and drying are removed.</p>

<p>There is yet another consideration, that is, the presence of acetate of
lead, always found in varying quantities in the incrustation produced,
and remaining at the close of the operation and conversion. To remove
this, careful washing, and after-stoving and drying must be
accomplished. The amount of this salt present is found to differ with
each operation, and in various portions of the same make.</p>

<p>The washing out of the acetate is never perfect, and it involves a large
amount of labour.</p>

<p>Opinions differ as to the effect of this acetate if allowed to remain in
the product. White lead makers on the “stack” principle aver that it
should and must be washed out, lest it should damage the qualities of
the paint. This is questionable, and not one can produce practical
evidence of its being the cause of any damage if still contained in
white lead. Facts seem to deny its harmfulness in this respect, inasmuch
as the best prepared samples, those washed and dried from the most
careful makers, will be found upon analysis to contain more or less of
acetate of lead.</p>

<p>A large proportion of this salt in white lead may not be beneficial for
many reasons, but a small percentage can do no harm; nay, for many
purposes it may be good.</p>

<p>There is no substance used for driers for white lead that is more
esteemed than this acetate of lead, commonly known as “sugar of lead.”</p>

<p>A small amount of this salt present in white lead would communicate
drying properties, and this alone is what it could do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Granting that we can discover a method of producing white lead of
amorphous character, of good density, free from all discoloration, free
from all particles of metallic lead, and free from all but a small
percentage of acetate of lead, then washing will not be needed.</p>

<p>Stoving and drying become unnecessary. The work of women, their deadly
occupation, so burdensome to the operatives and to all with whom they
are concerned, is done away with.</p>

<p><i>Condy’s Process.</i>&mdash;An improvement in the manufacture of white lead was
patented by Condy, of Battersea, in 1881, which, though giving perfectly
satisfactory results when carefully conducted, necessitated special
precautions, and led to his substituting in practice the following
additions and modifications, which are of great consequence in rendering
the process more certain in the quality of its product, and more
valuable as a commercial manufacture on the practical scale, by virtue
of its offering greatly increased facility and economy in production.</p>

<p>The results of numerous and repeated experiments on the larger scale
induced Condy to qualify the recommendation contained in his first
patent, viz. that of employing a solution of tribasic acetate of lead
and bicarbonate of soda in proper proportion to precipitate nearly the
whole of the lead, and further stating that he preferred to employ “a
slight excess of tribasic lead salt rather than find carbonate of soda
in excess.” Though, when carefully conducted, if the greatest nicety is
observed, a satisfactory result is obtained; in practice, the least
variation from the exact composition of the two substances is attended
with the drawback that the white lead is liable to a slight uncertainty
of tint after it is ground in oil, whereas by the process hereinafter
described a positive and reliable result can be obtained, as the white
lead produced will be of a uniform white colour, and not liable to turn
when ground in oil. Though the earlier process was in itself complete
for the manufacture of white lead from oxide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span> of lead, it afterwards
occurred to Condy that a great object would be attained in rendering the
process more valuable and more practical, if a method were devised,
worked out, and described for the manufacture of tribasic acetate of
lead to be made entirely from metallic lead by the action of acetic acid
or neutral acetate of lead on metallic lead, and not to be dependent on
the employment in any way of previously manufactured oxide of lead.</p>

<p>This portion of Condy’s invention relating to the manufacture of
tribasic acetate of lead may be described as follows: he melts, and,
after skimming carefully, feathers the metallic lead by dropping it into
water; he places this granulated lead in wooden vessels or vats
previously fitted with perforated false bottoms under which are fixed
taps for drawing the liquor off into other vats or tanks placed on a
lower level. Having filled with granulated lead the vessels fitted with
the false bottoms, he fills up the interstices with a dilute acetic acid
composed of one part, by weight, of acid (specific gravity 1·045 at 60°
F.) and 12½ parts of water, and after allowing the dilute acid to stand
for two hours, draws it off through the taps into the lower tanks. This
allows access of atmospheric air to the lead, which has the effect of
heating the lead so that oxidation takes place.</p>

<p>After a time (about three or four hours), this oxidation begins to
slacken, when he pumps up a second time the acid solution from the lower
vat on to the granulated lead, and allows them to stand in contact for
one hour; he then again draws off the liquid into the lower tank, and
again exposes the metallic lead to atmospheric oxidation, allowing three
or four hours for the latter operation; and if the solution of lead has
not already attained the specific gravity of 1·040, at 60° F., he again
repasses the liquor over the metallic lead partially oxidised, until it
has attained that specific gravity, when he places the dissolved lead
with fresh granulated lead and recommences the manufacture in the same
way.</p>

<p>This operation succeeds much better on the large scale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> than on a
laboratory scale. In vats containing upwards of one ton of lead, the
result is all that can be desired, and can be obtained by passing the
liquor from twice to three times over the metallic lead partially
oxidised. A little practice enables the operator so to control the
process that he can obtain the solution of the desired specific gravity
with perfect ease.</p>

<p>This plan of manufacturing tribasic acetate of lead possesses the
advantage of producing that substance wholly or nearly wholly free from
the impurities contained in metallic lead, such as copper and silver,
which are not taken up, or soluble, in the presence of metallic lead. In
consequence of the circumstance that foreign matter is left almost
untouched, it is practicable to make white lead of a fine quality from
old lead such as lead piping, roofing, and worn out lead generally,
which can thus be utilised to greater advantage than in any other way.</p>

<p>Having obtained this solution of basic acetate of lead of the specific
gravity of 1·040 at 60° F., Condy proceeds as follows:&mdash;To the solution
produced by each 60 lb. of acid and 750 lb. of water previously pumped
up into another vat or tank, he adds bicarbonate of soda in the
proportion of 30 lb. for each 60 lb. by weight of acid originally
employed, and agitates the mixture. This will generally precipitate all
the white lead, but it is necessary to test the filtrate to ascertain
the exact point when all the lead is thrown down. Sufficient bicarbonate
of soda should be added to do this completely, and it would be better to
use bicarbonate of soda in excess rather than leave any lead
unprecipitated, as by this means greater certainty is obtained in
securing on the large and practical scale a white lead capable of
standing the effect of light and grinding in oil without changing. The
white lead after precipitation can be washed, pressed, and dried in the
usual way.</p>

<p>The following variation may be made from the method described of making
tribasic acetate of lead, thus:&mdash;To each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> 60 lb. of acid and 750 lb. of
water may be added sufficient of the tribasic solution to make neutral
acetate of lead, with which to recommence the manufacture of tribasic
acetate of lead by the process described. Vague reference has been made
in works on technical chemistry to the possibility of using metallic
lead in the manufacture of sugar of lead, but such references have been
practically worthless, as they contain no information of a practical
nature even for the manufacture of neutral acetate of lead, and no
process at all has ever been described for the manufacture of basic
acetate of lead from metallic lead acted on by acetic acid or acetate of
lead.</p>

<p><i>Gardner’s Process.</i>&mdash;The conditions observed and fulfilled in the
arrangements adopted by Prof. E. V. Gardner, are founded upon a study of
the nature, properties and behaviour of the substances concerned, under
certain methods of treatment.</p>

<p>There are several oxides of lead which may be formed under special
conditions.&mdash;(1) Pb<sub>2</sub>O, and the same oxide combined with water
Pb<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>; (2) PbO, and the same oxide combined with water
PbH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In the hydrated form these oxides combine readily with
carbonic acid, but they do not combine readily with carbonic acid when
dehydrated. The hydrates are most readily formed at about 120°-130° F.,
and are decomposed after they are formed if heated to 212° F.</p>

<p>These oxides and their hydrates combine with acetic acid to form acetate
and sub-acetate of lead, and with nitric acid to form nitrate and
sub-nitrate of lead.</p>

<p>Lead, submitted to the action of air, watery vapour, and acetic or
nitric acid, or a mixture of these acids, with air or oxygen, with
proper precautions, forms sub-acetate or sub-nitrate of lead, and this
sub-acetate or sub-nitrate of lead readily absorbs carbonic acid and
forms carbonate and sub-carbonate of lead.</p>

<p>Sufficient acetic or nitric acid, or a mixture of these and air or
oxygen, and watery vapour, must be constantly sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>plied to form the
subsalts of lead, to carry on the operation of converting blue lead into
white lead; but an excess or an insufficiency of these agents will in
either case prevent the formation of sub-acetate or sub-nitrate, and
consequently of the sub-carbonates.</p>

<p>Thus&mdash;too little air, acetic acid and aqueous vapour prevents the
formation of the hydrated sub-acetate and consequently sub-carbonate of
lead. Too much acetic acid and aqueous vapour, and too little air forms
an acetate on the surface of the lead, which, by the excess of water,
dissolves and wastes, and washes the lead; it also varnishes the surface
of the lead with a coating of acetate, and checks, if it does not
completely prevent, the formation of sub-acetate of lead, and
consequently the formation of carbonate and sub-carbonate of lead.
Similar rules hold good in the case of nitric acid and the formation of
nitrate and sub-nitrate.</p>

<p>The process of forming the hydrated sub-acetate or sub-nitrate of lead
is most energetic at a temperature of 120°-130° F. In a lower
temperature, a much longer time is occupied in carrying out the process
of conversion; while at a higher temperature the delicate sub-acetate or
sub-nitrate of lead first formed suffers loss of water, until, at 212°
F., it is completely dehydrated. At a temperature about 135° F., the
power of forming carbonate and sub-carbonates is lessened, and at 212°
F. is considerably diminished. The carbonate itself is dehydrated at
212° F., and is decomposed at a higher temperature.</p>

<p>To obtain a white lead of excellent quality for its various uses, it is
necessary to produce a substance which possesses sufficient body to
cover surfaces to which it may be applied as paint, and it must possess
sufficient base to combine with the oil of the paint to form a vehicle
or varnish to retain and hold the body on the surface. This is found to
be the case with sub-carbonate of lead, or especially with a compound
constituted of two or three equivalents of carbonate of lead, with one
equivalent of hydrated oxide of that metal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Lead, to be attacked by chemical agents, should possess a clean surface.
If the surface of the lead is <i>chemically</i> clean, so much the better.
The surface of the lead should be extended as much as possible, and
exposed to the action of the gases and vapours at a certain heat for its
conversion into white lead.</p>

<p>If the most favourable conditions are sought, the temperature should be
between 120° and 130° F.; and to carry on the chemical action most
satisfactorily, the lead during its conversion should present a granular
coating&mdash;that is, the coating formed by the chemical agents should be
granular and not smooth and continuous in character. It should be
porous, and not of a continuous varnish-like or vitreous character.</p>

<p>To rapidly carry on the chemical action, the chemical agents should be
well diffused and commingled throughout each other, and the blue lead
should be so exposed as to be open to their attack on all parts of its
surface equally, and all should be at, and kept at, a proper temperature
and a proper degree of humidity. Too dry a heat prevents the process of
conversion. Too moist an atmosphere wastes the materials and arrests
their action. The conditions, therefore, which are most favourable will
be a certain humid atmosphere of well diffused and commingled vapours or
gases, acting on metallic lead exposed to them under the physical
conditions described, and at a temperature between 110° and 135° F.</p>

<p>These favourable conditions can be further augmented by certain
electrical arrangements in connection with them.</p>

<p>Again, in the sources from which the carbonic acid is derived, and in
the arrangement of the apparatus for applying the carbonic acid,
favourable and unfavourable conditions can be imported. Thus, by using
paraffin, petroleum, benzine, or light oil of paraffin or petroleum, or
similar carbonaceous substances free from sulphur, or mixtures of such
carbonaceous substances either alone or mixed with air or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span> other
oxidising substance, comparatively pure carbonic acid may be furnished
without at the same time producing any objectionable compounds.</p>

<p>As a result of his researches and experiments, Prof. Gardner has
proposed (Eng. Pat. 1882, No. 731) certain improvements in the method of
converting blue lead into white lead, in the apparatus employed, and in
the method of making and applying the carbonic acid used in the process.
Some of these improvements are applicable to the open stack or chamber
process, while others relate to closed chambers.</p>

<p>Preferably, for the conversion of blue lead into white lead, Prof.
Gardner adopts a closed, but not air-tight, chamber. This chamber is
ventilated or relieved so as to enable the incoming gases and vapours to
enter it without hindrance, and to escape by means of an exit valve and
pipe, or an exit shaft, connected with the chamber, communicating with
the exterior air, and regulated by a valve or damper. The gases and
vapours within the chamber can find their way out by this exit shaft
only, by slight pressure on expansion from within the chamber; thus the
interior of the chamber is preserved from disturbance, by preventing the
formation of currents within its atmosphere, and yet a perfect
circulation of the gases and vapours is kept up.</p>

<p>To warm the interior of this chamber, which is constructed of any
material that will resist the action of the vapours and gases, and which
is not too absorbent, Prof. Gardner makes the bottom of the chamber of
such a shape as to form a heating vessel to hold water or steam, this
water or steam, or both, being kept at the required temperature by means
of a steam coil. Matters are so arranged that the contents of this coil
are protected from any excess of pressure, and consequently the
temperature seldom or never exceeds about 212° F., unless for any
special reason it is desired to raise it to a higher point. Sometimes
the sides are constructed similarly to the bottom.</p>

<p>The materials of which these chambers are constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> must be capable
of resisting the heated and acidified vapours within them. Cast or
wrought iron faced with glass, slate, tiles, pewter, or glazed bricks;
tinned copper, tinned brass, or pewter; timber, whether green or after
carbonising by heat or sulphuric acid; all are more or less suitable.
Means of observing the progress of the conversion, and means of lifting
the contents in or out, must also be provided, as well as thermometers
to indicate the temperature prevailing inside.</p>

<p>The gases and vapours which effect the conversion of the blue lead into
white lead are generated outside the chamber just described, and are
conducted into it by means of pipes, being first raised to such a
temperature in excess of that which should exist inside the converting
chamber as to allow for the cooling effect arising from the friction and
loss of heat in passing through the various pipes and distributors
attached to the converting chamber.</p>

<p>Owing to this extra heating, the gases and vapours are expanded,
diffused, and commingled, and do not rob the interior of the converting
chamber of any heat on entering it, so that the heat inside the
converting chamber is kept constant, and can operate to further expand
and diffuse the gases and vapours in contact with the blue lead inside
the chamber. In practice it is found that the temperature of the
converting chamber cannot be suitably controlled if any portion of the
gases or vapours be generated within that chamber.</p>

<p>The blue lead is arranged in the converting chamber in trays, or on
shelves or frames, so as to allow it to be completely surrounded and
attacked by the vapours or gases, and thereby be converted into white
lead, at the same time preventing the formation of direct currents or
eddies. Framed supports resembling a dinner waggon serve well for
holding the lead, and may easily be arranged to lift bodily in and out
of the chamber with their burden of blue or white lead. The surface on
which the blue lead is directly supported is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> made of graphitic carbon,
hard coke, platinum, or carbonised or platinised material, such as is
used for plates in electric batteries, or of other material standing in
a similar electrical relationship to lead, or capable of generating with
it an electric current.</p>

<p>In applying this development of electrical energy to the ordinary
“stack,” as for instance the Dutch process, the pots containing the
acetous liquid and blue lead are made of, or lined with, such electrical
carbon, or contain a portion of it in suspension, by which the same
effect is realised. Advantage may also be derived from furnishing a
supplementary supply of carbonic acid to the stack beyond that due to
the decomposing dung, &amp;c.; as well as from injecting a current of air or
oxygen at suitable temperatures, and from the admission of steam in a
coil throughout the stack.</p>

<p>The generation or production of the acetic or nitric acid vapours is
attained by heat in a vessel so arranged that its contents are kept at a
certain temperature for vaporising, by having the boiling acid solution
at about 1·003 sp. gr., procured by mixing water with vinegar or acetic
or nitric acids.</p>

<p>The supply pipes conveying the air or oxygen and the carbonic acid, or
either of them, can easily be made to emit their contents close to the
boiling acid solution, whereby the vapours arising from the latter are
mixed and intermingled with them, and all pass together through the
pipes and distributors into the converting chamber or stack.</p>

<p>In preparing the carbonic acid it is necessary to observe certain
precautions, especially that it shall be pure and that no carbonic oxide
shall gain admission to the chamber. If the ordinary chalk and carbon
method be employed, the furnace must be provided at the uptake with a
series of air inlets, so as to ensure that the gases passing from the
furnace to the delivery tube shall be most thoroughly oxidised.</p>

<p>The purification of the carbonic acid may be effected in the usual way
by passing it through a vessel containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span> water; or, if requisite, it
may be cleansed, expanded, and heated in one operation by passing it
through or over hot water, or over a hot aqueous solution of carbonate
of soda, all of which, however, incur considerable cost in plant and
manipulation.</p>

<p>Owing to these difficulties in purifying carbonic acid, Prof. Gardner
prefers to prepare a practically pure carbonic acid in the first place,
and this he does by allowing petroleum, benzine, paraffin, or other
hydrocarbon or carbonaceous liquid to gradually fall into a retort
containing chalk or other suitable carbonate at a high temperature,
whereby relatively pure carbonic acid gas is generated; and while still
in a highly heated state it encounters a stream of air or oxygen,
ensuring its complete combustion before entering the converting chamber.</p>

<p>Another method of procuring fairly pure carbonic acid is by the
combustion and oxidation of any of the liquid hydrocarbons mentioned
above, in suitable lamps; and when carbonic acid gas of exceptional
purity is required, it may be obtained by heating bicarbonates to a
sufficient degree to drive off one molecule of carbonic acid, reducing
the bicarbonate to carbonate, from which it can be reproduced by
treatment with carbonic acid gas obtained from cheaper sources.</p>

<p>The <i>modus operandi</i> adopted by Prof. Gardner is as follows: The lead is
granulated and prepared for conversion in one operation, thus&mdash;an iron
or a slate slab about 2-3 inches thick is placed in a tank containing
acetic or nitric acid solutions rising about 3 inches above the upper
surface of the slab. The lead is melted at low red heat and poured from
a height of 4 to 6 feet into the acid solution, through which it falls
till it encounters the slab, and thereupon passes away into the
surrounding solution, being thus converted into a spongy condition. In
this condition the lead is spread on frames or trays, which are then
lifted bodily into their places in the converting chambers. The latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
is closed and heated to 120° F. for 3-4 hours, or until the whole
contents have assumed a uniform temperature. Thereupon the acid vapours
and air are admitted and distributed, taking care that the temperature
is not thereby reduced below 110° F. nor increased above 125° F., steam
being temporarily shut off if necessary. This treatment is continued for
24 hours.</p>

<p>The admission of aqueous vapour should be so regulated that while a dry
atmosphere is avoided, yet there is no appreciable condensation of
moisture in the chamber. While ensuring this condition, the temperature
may reach as high as 130° F. for a second period of 24 hours, but must
not overstep the limits of 120° F. minimum and 135° F. maximum.</p>

<p>After 48 hours’ treatment, the supply of duly warmed carbonic acid gas
is admitted for a period of two hours, without discontinuing the
introduction of acid vapours, air and steam; and this addition of
carbonating gas is repeated for two hours at a time with intervals of
four hours during which it is cut off. When, after four or five days,
efflorescence or exfoliation appears on the lead, the supply of carbonic
gas is increased to two hours in every four, or four in every six; and
the admission of acid vapours, air and steam may also be augmented so
long as the temperature is not allowed to exceed 130°-135°F. The whole
operation is completed in seven to fourteen days.</p>

<p>Of this process, Mr. Carter Bell, in his paper before referred to,
speaks in the highest terms. No washing or drying is necessary. No women
are engaged in the manufacture, and but few men. The white lead thus
produced by the aid of electricity is deposited in a peculiar state of
disintegration, it is perfectly amorphous and non-crystalline, of the
purest quality; its density is 5·8. When ground in oil and made into
paint, it possesses great body and a covering power inferior to no other
paint, if not superior to them all.</p>

<p>Painters who have used the paint, practical men, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> amongst these we
may observe coach painters, have pronounced its excellence and
superiority to the best ordinary white lead paint.</p>

<p>By this electrical process of manufacture, not only is the time consumed
in the making and in the preparation of this material greatly shortened,
but the cost of preparation is reduced, and added to this is the
important fact, the vital factor in our consideration. The labour of
women is unnecessary. No lives are sacrificed to its working
requirements.</p>

<p>Prof. E. V. Gardner, who has been for some years occupying his attention
with the subject of white lead making, with a view especially to
remedying its existing evils, has invented his electrical chamber
process of manufacture, and an entirely new course of after treatment.
He has for the last seven or eight years been more or less occupied
perfecting his conception, and accommodating it to practical and
commercial claims.</p>

<p>Chamber processes are not new, there have been several patents enrolled
for making white lead in closed chambers, but none has proved
commercially convenient or practically successful in its adaptation, and
none has survived to the present time.</p>

<p>In Germany, white lead is made in chambers at the present day. The lead
in gratings or sheets is supported on wooden rods, saddle fashion, the
chamber is then filled, and its contents are submitted to currents of
acetic acid vapour, air, steam, and carbonic acid gas; the time needful
for conversion is six or seven weeks. The after steps in the separation
of the incrustation, and its preparation for trade purposes are much the
same as in the “stack” product preparation. It is washed, stoved, dried,
and ground. The white lead made on the German plan does not differ in
any material degree, save it be in price, from the best English
commodity. We may assume that the washing and drying in Germany consumes
a like period of time to that process in English works, viz. two or
three weeks. We then see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> that the German plan of making white lead
cannot be perfected in less than eight or ten weeks’ time from the
commencement of the corroding action in the chamber. To compare these
facts and the efficiency of the different plans described:&mdash;</p>

<p>The time required to complete the corrosion in the stack is at least 14
or 16 weeks.</p>

<p>The Gardner’s electric process requires for the same purpose only 14
days.</p>

<p>As to point of time, the German plan excels the stack, and can be
carried out in one-half the time required in the stack method of
conversion.</p>

<p>The Gardner’s electrical method excels the German, and can be perfected
in one-third the time needed for the German chamber operation, and
one-sixth the time required the stack.</p>

<p>These figures open out a most important matter when we regard the
capital invested and lying dormant in stack lead works.</p>

<p>It is well known that we have in electricity a most powerful agent by
which to effect the chemical combination of various substances on the
one hand, or on the other, by its means to break up and disrupt a
chemical compound. Professor Gardner’s main principle of action in his
new process is founded upon these facts, and he takes advantage of
electrical power to cause the combination of the lead with the necessary
elements to build up white lead in his chambers. He either employs
electrical discharges to energise and render active in their chemical
affinities the various materials engaged, or he so disposes of them as
to form an electric or galvanic combination in the chamber. In the
latter arrangement the chamber and its contents represent a gas battery
on an extensive scale. In practice he prefers the latter plan; it is
more simple, more manageable in the hands of the ordinary workmen. The
original plan was to have graphite or graphitic carbon plates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> or
supports for the buckles or gratings of lead within the converting
chamber. These carbon plates and the lead to be converted, were so
placed as to form a collection of galvanic “couples” or “pairs,” and in
this condition were submitted to the gases entering the chamber from
without. It will be understood that various modes of arrangement would
occur without departing from the principle concerned.</p>

<p>In practice this method answered very well, but presently a difficulty
arose; not only were the graphitic carbon or graphitic plates expensive,
but they were easily broken, and became friable in use. Carbon plates of
an especial kind were manufactured to meet these failures and remedy
these defects, not without success, but still open to objection. In
looking round for some substitute to replace the carbon, two points were
to be kept in view, to seek some electro-negative to lead like the
carbon, and some electro-conductive like it, and some material that
would bear rough handling such as workmen give, and be practically
convenient in its adaptation to a working chamber.</p>

<p>Gold or platinum would excel in these particulars, but there are
considerations which debar their use. Pure tin presented itself, and tin
was tried with great success. Tin would at first be thought, on account
of its close electrical relationship to lead, far from favourable to the
purpose. Graphite or carbon would appear far more suitable. Practice
pronounced the tin to act as efficiently as carbon. This may at first
seem contradictory and strange, but if we consider that while the carbon
is certainly more highly electro-negative to lead than tin, yet the tin
is the more conductive, and offers the less resistance to the electric
current of the two; in this manner the tin compensates by its conductive
power all it may lack, as compared with carbon, in electrical energy
when coupled up with lead.</p>

<p>Tin plate is now used as the electric-negative element in the chamber of
the Gardner plan. Tin plate means pure tin. Ingot tin is rolled out into
plates, the bottom of the chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> is covered with this pure tin plate,
so are the bearers and the shelves, or supports which are to hold the
lead during its conversion. Tin pipes and tin fittings, which resist the
action of acetic acid, are also used to conduct the gases to the chamber
to carry on the converting operation, and to preserve the product from
any source of discoloration.</p>

<p>When a chamber is prepared for the converting operation, the whole of
the lead it contains will be in metallic communication with the tin
supports, and these with the tin covered bottom of the chamber.</p>

<p>The chamber when working is kept at a certain temperature by a steam
coil beneath the floor of the chamber. The process is simple. The lead
buckles or gratings are placed on tin-covered stands, somewhat in form
and make like a dinner-waggon. The whole is hauled up and dipped into a
bath of acetic acid and acetate of lead; it there remains for one or two
minutes, it is then hauled out, drained and lifted bodily through the
top into the chamber. Other stands filled with buckles are so dipped and
so placed till the space of the chamber is fully occupied.</p>

<p>This dipping cleanses the surface of the metal, and when it is exposed
to the air it is speedily coated with a hydrated oxide of lead. This is
the first step in the process of conversion. The chamber when filled is
closed, and its temperature is brought to about 100° F.; then vapour of
acetic acid and vapour of water and air are supplied from without to the
interior of the chamber. This is continued for 15 or 20 hours. The lead
buckles within the chamber will now possess a whitish coating,
consisting of subhydrate and subacetate of lead, and they will present a
uniform colour. Carbonic acid generated in any convenient manner is next
passed into the acid generator; it mixes with the other gases and
vapours, and with them goes on its way to supply the chamber. Speedily
the action of the carbonic acid is observed, the surface lead becomes
quite white and presents the appearance of a snow shower having fallen
within the chamber. The formation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span> white lead is now speedily
effected. This treatment is continued throughout the space of 13 days;
at the end of this time the supply of acetic acid vapour is stopped, and
the supply of air, steam and carbonic acid is continued, according as it
is desired to obtain white lead rich in oxide or in carbonate.</p>

<p>After a short further period, steam and air only are sent into the
chamber, which is varied in temperature to 120° or 130°F., and lastly
the steam supply is stopped; air alone enters the chamber, which is kept
heated by the coils beneath the floor. The contents of the chamber are
now in a dry state, and the operation is terminated.</p>

<p>It will occur to most readers that these terminal proceedings amount in
effect to a convenient method of washing and drying the white lead while
it is still attached to the parent lead, and this it is in fact.</p>

<p>The contents of the converting chamber are lifted out through the opened
top, and the buckles or gratings with their crust of white lead are
turned into the agitator. This agitator is an iron cage revolving inside
a closed chamber of the same material. During the revolution of this
cylinder or cage, the contained lead gratings fall from side to side,
and the incrustation on their surfaces becomes detached and broken up.
It falls in, this broken state through the bars of the cage or cylinder
into a receptacle beneath. The denuded buckles or gratings are retained
in the cylinder and are removed. These gratings or buckles are cast of
such a thickness as to withstand two or three converting operations in
the chamber before they are recast.</p>

<p>This crude white lead is carried by an elevator, or it falls into the
hopper of a pair of granite crushing rolls, also enclosed; and from
these it passes into the mixer or incorporator from which it can be
removed in a dry state or mixed with oil.</p>

<p>The incrustation of white lead will be found upon examination to be
possessed of some peculiarities, the result of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> the electrical action
which has been going on within the chamber. It is quite white. It falls
from the lead buckle or grating which it coats, if the grating be struck
against a piece of wood with but a slight blow. It is easily friable,
and can be rubbed to the finest powder between the thumb and finger, or
on the palm of the hand.</p>

<p>Now, we may explain, as we conceive it, the philosophy of its production
in this state of disintegration.</p>

<p>We know that a feeble and prolonged current of electricity will in time
deposit metals from their solutions in a crystalline condition, and that
if we quicken the current of electricity and cause it more energetically
to act on the same solution, we can precipitate the metal from that
solution in a state of powder.</p>

<p>It is to similar action of electricity as that to which we last refer
that we ascribe the formation of the crust on the gratings of lead in
the non-adherent and disintegrated condition in which it is produced,
and by reason of which it is so easily detached from the lead and broken
up to powder. No edge runner grinding, such as is required by the stack
process, is in this case necessary.</p>

<p>The crude white lead and crushed material, whether in a dry state, or
incorporated with oil, is finished and ground in a granite roller paint
mill, from which it issues as dry white lead, or as white lead in oil.</p>

<p>Paint made from this electric white lead has been sent to America, to
France, to Belgium, to Germany for trial, and has also been largely
tested in this country by painters, engineers, and others unacquainted
with its precise nature, and it has been productive of good results.</p>

<p>Of its density, body, and covering power, there can be no doubt, and
never once have these qualities been called in question.</p>

<p>The cost of the manufacture of white lead by the stack process is about
3<i>l.</i> to 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per ton. By the German method, the cost is about
the same as by the stack. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> Gardner’s electric process, the cost of
conversion is 10<i>s</i>. a ton. To this 10<i>s.</i> must be added the cost of
labour expended in preparation, an item which cannot be well estimated
on the present limited scale of manufacture; it could not exceed an
additional 15<i>s.</i> a ton. This would bring the cost of manufacture of
electric white lead to 25<i>s.</i> a ton.</p>

<p>In this electric process inferior lead can be operated upon with
success. Brands of that metal such as white lead makers by the stack
method dare not employ, may be successfully converted in an electric
chamber, and with fair results as to the quantity and quality of the
white lead produced.</p>

<p>By the use of Gardner’s electric process it would appear that we not
only preserve health, but save lives; we not only save time, but
interest on large capitals, which lie idle for long periods at a time;
and we can economise and simplify the whole manufacture and preparation
of white lead, divesting it of all its present cumbersome and unhealthy
stages. Gardner’s process, we believe, must take a prominent position as
one of the most necessary, valuable, and scientific inventions of modern
times.</p>

<p><i>Hannay’s Process.</i>&mdash;Mr. J. B. Hannay, whose name is well known in
connection with various chemical and engineering inventions and
processes, has recently brought out a process for the manufacture of
white lead. The old method of producing white lead or carbonate of lead
is one involving much time and labour, together with no small risk to
the health of the workpeople. By the new process brought out by Mr.
Hannay, sulphate of lead is manufactured direct from galena or lead ore,
without the necessity of the intermediate process of the reduction of
the ore and the extraction of metallic lead. It is said that the
sulphate of lead produced by the new process is whiter and more
permanent than the carbonate.</p>

<p>The process is described as follows:&mdash;A furnace, 36 in. by 30 in., and
48 in. deep, contracting to a narrow chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> about 36 in. long by 14
in. wide, communicating with the main flue, is charged with coke and
brought to a red heat. The bed of coke is so thick as to be almost up to
the level of the sill of the furnace door. The lead ore is not charged
in large quantity and left for an indefinite time, but is thrown in in
quantities of a few shovelfuls at a time, the object being to effect
extremely rapid volatilisation and consequent oxidation. The proportion
of ore to fuel is 1 ton to 1 ton, and the result is said to be the
conversion of 95 per cent. of the charge into its equivalent in white
lead. In the first or wide chamber, the coke is oxidised, carbonic oxide
being the resulting gas, the rapid volatilisation of the galena or
sulphide of lead also taking place in the same chamber. On entering the
inner portion of the furnace, the volatilised sulphide of lead and the
carbonic oxide are converted into carbonic acid and sulphate of lead.</p>

<p>Forced blast has been employed to cause the high temperature necessary
for the volatilisation of the ore; but it has been found unnecessary,
admission of air at atmospheric pressure through tuyere holes being
quite adequate. After leaving the inner chamber of the furnace, the
gases pass into a flue, level with the furnace, and about 40 feet long
by 16 square feet in sectional area. From this flue the gases pass into
a tower about 20 feet high, and from thence into wrought-iron flues 3
feet in diameter. These flues terminate in a wrought-iron chest, in
which are fitted two steam injectors. The gases are forced by these
injectors into the central chambers of the condensers. These condensers
are two in number, and contain a central chamber, 16 feet by 12 inches,
into which the gases are forced as described. The gases escape through
interstices into the outer chambers of the condenser, and are there
condensed, a continuous stream of water occupying the lower part of the
condenser. The waste gases escape by a downcast leading to a tall
chimney. The temperature of the gases as they enter the condenser is
about 840° F.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>The product is pumped from the condensers to a settling vat. Here it
settles for an hour, the deposit being pumped into a second vat and
washed with dilute sulphuric acid, in order to remove impurities. The
resulting product is washed several times with water, and is then passed
through a filter press. From the press it drops into bogies, which carry
the pulp to the drying house, where it is dried by hot air. The process
would thus appear an extremely simple and practical one. Several
chemical authorities of repute, as well as manufacturing firms and
others who have used the new white lead, have expressed themselves
strongly as to its merits. One point immensely in favour of sulphate of
lead as opposed to carbonate, is that the former is almost entirely
innocuous, whereas the poisonous properties of the other are well known.
It is claimed that the sulphate is not acted upon by coal gas or by the
atmosphere of towns, which is always more or less impregnated with gases
such as sulphuretted hydrogen, whose reactions with various metals have
only too good reason to be known.</p>

<p>According to the patent specification bearing the names of French and
Hannay, they employ lead ores, lead fume, or lead slags containing
sulphur; and when these materials do not contain sufficient sulphur to
form a sulphate with all the lead which sublimes in the process, they
add to them pyrites or other sulphur-yielding substance to make up the
deficiency. They heat the materials mixed with a suitable proportion of
coke in an air-blast cupola furnace, which is by preference of an
improved and special construction shown in <a href="#fig_18">Figs. 18 to 20</a>, and
hereinafter described; and they thereby produce sulphite of lead as a
sublimate, provided that there are no chlorides such as common salt
present in the charge, in which case sulphate and chloride of lead will
be formed.</p>

<p>The sublimate is carried forward with the current of gases through flues
to a fume condenser, which is by preference of the kind known as
Wilson’s and French’s. As the gases and sublimate pass through the
flues, hydrochloric acid is mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">with them, being by preference formed in a chamber in connection with
the flue, by introducing a solution of chloride of sodium in spray, and
by providing a sufficient excess of sulphurous acid beyond that required
for forming the sulphite of lead. Air is also present, and a well known
reaction takes place, yielding hydrochloric acid and sulphate of soda,
the operation taking place at a part of the flue near enough to the
furnace to be always at a red heat. The hydrochloric acid thus mixed
with the gases and sublimate causes the formation of chloro-sulphite of
lead, or other combinations of lead, sulphur, oxygen, and chlorine of
variable constitution, depending on the proportions of the several
constituents, but in most cases the product is a body which forms a
white pigment of extremely good quality.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a> is an elevation of their improved cupola furnace; <a href="#fig_19">Fig. 19</a> is a
corresponding vertical section; and <a href="#fig_20">Fig. 20</a> is a horizontal section as
at the level of the principal tuyeres.</p>

<p>This cupola furnace is formed with a deep hearth <i>a</i> (like the American
lead smelting cupola) having a siphon outlet <i>b</i>, for withdrawing molten
lead when necessary. At a level a little above the siphon outlet <i>b</i>, an
outlet <i>c</i> for slag and scoria is provided, and the main blast tuyeres
<i>d</i> enter at about the same or a slightly higher level. With this
arrangement, a considerable depth of melted lead is constantly
maintained, and the choking of materials is thereby avoided at the level
of the tuyeres. For a short distance above the main tuyeres <i>d</i>, the
interior of the furnace is made with the sides <i>e</i> moderately and
gradually widening upwards, and is afterwards continued upwards of
uniform diameter or width. The charging door <i>f</i> is between 3 and 4 feet
above the main tuyeres <i>d</i>, and the space above the charging door is
crossed by two or more arched diaphragms <i>g h</i>, of brickwork, having
irregular openings in them, there being doors <i>i k</i> in the side of the
furnace above each diaphragm, for inspection and cleaning. The purpose
of these diaphragms is to cause the air, gases, and sublimate to become
thoroughly intermixed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> to ensure the complete combustion of any
black smoke and the oxidation of any sulphide of lead that may be
present.</p>

<p>An upper series of small tuyeres or jet pipes <i>l</i> is provided for
admitting air a little below the lowest diaphragm <i>g</i>, these jet pipes
<i>l</i> being supplied by a branch pipe <i>m</i> from the main air blast pipe
<i>n</i>, it being found that the introduction of the air and the production
of heat can be best regulated by supplying a portion at the upper part
of the furnace in this way, in addition to that supplied by the main
tuyeres <i>d</i>; and a tap or valve <i>o</i> is fitted on the branch pipe <i>m</i> for
adjusting the supplementary supply thus admitted. Above the highest
perforated diaphragm <i>h</i>, the interior of the furnace communicates with
a lateral flue <i>p</i>, through which the gases and sublimate pass; and at a
part of this flue <i>p</i>, sufficiently near the surface for the gases to be
still hot enough, an enlargement or chamber <i>r</i> forming a descending
part of the flue, is constructed. Into this chamber <i>r</i> a solution of
chloride of sodium is introduced as a spray from a number of jet pipes
<i>s</i>, for the purpose hereinbefore explained. This chamber <i>r</i> is
provided with a door <i>t</i> at its lower part, for periodically removing
matters that become deposited in it. The continuation <i>u</i> of the flue
communicates with the lower part of the chamber <i>r</i>.</p>

<p>Preferably the spray of chloride of sodium is fine enough to allow of
all or nearly all of the water being instantly evaporated, so as to
leave the salt in fine particles, and in a favourable condition for
being acted upon by the sulphurous acid, steam, and oxygen present in
the gaseous currents. The temperature of the chamber <i>r</i> should not be
allowed to fall below red heat. The proportion of chloride of sodium
used will depend on the amount of chlorination of the lead that may be
desired, in addition to what is necessary for converting the zinc and
other metals into chlorides. In practice a proportion of salt 2½ to 5
per cent. of the weight of the sublimate formed answers the purpose and
yields a good product, but a larger proportion may be used without
injury.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>It is of great importance to keep the temperature of the upper part of
the furnace steadily at a red heat and flaming, as the colour of the
sublimate will be inferior if the temperature is either too high or too
low. To facilitate the proper regulation of the temperature, a pyrometer
(which may be similar to the kind used in ironworks) is employed, which
pyrometer is placed in the flue at a distance from the furnace where it
cannot be injured; and by a few trials is ascertained what temperature
should be indicated by the pyrometer when the temperature in the furnace
is what it should be. This point having been ascertained, a glance at
the pyrometer will at any time show whether the furnace is working
properly or not. The inventors also provide for rapidly cooling the
upper part of the furnace without interfering with the lower part, in
the event of the heat becoming too great, by arranging a water pipe <i>w</i>,
with a set of jets, round the top of the furnace, so that on turning a
tap on the supply pipe a spray of water may be applied to the outside of
the furnace; and as it is desirable that water applied in this way
should not run down to the lower part of the furnace they build gutter
plates <i>x</i> into the sides of the furnace just above the charging door
<i>f</i>, to lead off any surplus water to a drain pipe.</p>

<p>Sufficient hydrochloric acid may be formed or introduced, as
hereinbefore described, not only for forming chloro-sulphite of lead in
the condenser, but also for saturating all the free oxide of lead, and
for combining with and rendering soluble any iron, zinc, antimony,
silver, or other metals. The chlorides thus formed become dissolved in
the water of the condenser, and the solution, separated from the
insoluble white pigment, may be treated by known processes for recovery
of the metals. When the lead ores or other lead-yielding materials
contain silver to a greater extent than 5 oz. per ton, a notable
quantity of the silver is volatilised, and if it is left in the white
pigment it renders the latter sensitive to sunlight; whereas if rendered
soluble in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> manner hereinbefore described, and separated by any of
the known processes, it becomes a source of profit.</p>

<p>The white pigment is washed in the ordinary way; and when chloride of
zinc is not completely removed by washing, a small quantity of sulphuric
acid may be mixed with the pigment, by adding the same to the last
washing water, to convert the chloride of zinc into sulphate, which is
not hygroscopic.</p>

<p>The white pigment made as hereinbefore described is a very good and
economical material for manufacturing into chrome yellow, this being
done by mixing a solution of any suitable chromate or bichromate with
the wet pigment; whilst the chrome yellow thus obtained may be converted
into chrome orange or red by treating it in the usual way.</p>

<p><i>Italian Process.</i>&mdash;The precise period of the introduction of white-lead
manufacture in Italy is unknown, but it was certainly previous to the
beginning of the present century. Prior to 1881, the Dutch process was
exclusively used in Italy. In 1881 the so-called Brumlen and Dahn
process was introduced into Liguria. Somewhat later the Rhenish process
was introduced. The Rhenish process is one in use in nearly all the
Italian white-lead manufactories. It is employed in a large manufactory
at Cogoleto, as follows:&mdash;Lead in thin sheets of about 3 feet in length,
and 4 inches in width are placed in a clay chamber having the form of a
cube, of about the capacity of 5800 cubic feet. In this chamber there is
a wooden framework, upon which are hung the sheets of lead. Three of
these sheets weigh together about 4½ lb., and as the capacity of the
chamber is about 20 tons, it can hold about 30,000 sheets of lead.</p>

<p>On the floor of the chamber are placed twenty-four copper receptacles,
each having four circular apertures. These receptacles are all in direct
communication with a large pipe of masonry, which, by means of a copper
tube, receives the gas coming from a boiler and furnace placed under the
chamber. In the boiler, which is also of copper, is placed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span> mixture of
900 parts of water, and 80 parts of acetic acid concentrated to 40°, and
the capacity of the boiler is about equivalent to 25,882 gallons. The
furnace serves the purpose of producing carbonic acid.</p>

<p>The gaseous mixture, consisting of volatilised acetic acid, carbonic
acid, and aqueous vapour, is admitted from the boiler and furnace into
the chamber in quantity and proportions best adapted to each stage of
the work. The chemical reactions resulting are analogous to those which
take place in the Dutch process, and the Brumlen and Dahn process. Each
operation lasts six weeks, and gives a product of about 20 tons of white
lead, with a consumption of 7 per cent. of acetic acid, and 9 tons of
coke. The residuum of lead is about 10 per cent. of the quantity placed
in the chamber. At the end of each operation the white lead taken from
the chamber is washed and purified in large tubs, some of which are
furnished with filters. Finally, it is packed in earthen vessels, and
dried, when it is ready for the market, and is sold either in cakes or
powder.</p>

<p>The establishment at Cogoleto, above referred to, is able to produce
annually about 2000 tons of white lead, of which 1200 tons are produced
by the Rhenish process, and 800 tons by the Brumlen and Dahn process.
There is also in a manufactory in Milan, the process of revolving
heaters. The process of precipitation has not yet been used in Italy.
The Rhenish process, as above described, furnishes the greater part of
Italian white lead. The smaller manufacturers still use the Dutch
process, but the Brumlen and Dahn process is generally regarded as
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>It is believed that the production of white lead in Italy during the
first ten years of this century was about 300 tons per annum. The total
annual production at present is, in round numbers, about 3500 tons, of
which 2800 are produced in the Ligurian manufactories, and about 300 in
those of Naples. Milan also produces about 300 tons.</p>

<p>The product finds a market almost exclusively in Italy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> The annual
amount exported is about 300 tons, and goes chiefly to Constantinople.
Of the quantity of 2000 tons per annum produced at Cogoleto, about 300
tons is sold mixed with oil. No exact statistics are attainable as to
the total amount of Italian white lead which is annually sold other than
in the dry state, but it is believed to be little, if any, larger than
300 tons.</p>

<p>When the price of white lead was high, sulphate of baryta was mixed with
carbonate of lead to produce white lead of inferior quality, but in
consequence of the present price of white lead the use of sulphate of
baryta has almost entirely ceased. No other methods of adulteration are
known to be in use. In Italy, white lead is universally known as
“<i>biacca</i>” when it is sold in cakes. When sold in powder it is known as
“<i>carbonato di piombo</i>” (carbonate of lead). The lead from which all the
white lead made in Italy is manufactured comes from the lead mines of
the island of Sardinia, with the exception of a very small quantity of
argentiferous lead coming from Spain. The acetic acid used in the
process of manufacture comes from France. The market price of white lead
in Italy is now about 45 lire the quintal (equivalent to 18<i>s</i>. per
cwt.).</p>

<p><i>Lewis’s Process.</i>&mdash;Many attempts have been made to substitute for
carbonate of lead&mdash;the ordinary poisonous white lead, that slowly but
surely induces paralysis in those who come in contact with it for any
considerable period&mdash;some less deleterious pigment. Zinc white has often
been put forward as a substitute, and is indeed largely employed; but it
is open to the objection of not possessing sufficient body or opacity.
Sulphate of lead is not poisonous; but, when prepared in the ordinary
way by precipitation, is of a crystalline nature, and, therefore,
wanting in both these qualities.</p>

<p>A sulphate of lead has, however, been produced by John T. Lewis, of
Philadelphia, by sublimation, which, when treated by the Freeman
process, is stated to possess a body and colour superior to the best
white lead made by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> ordinary process, with the additional merit of
being cheaper, while it is also non-poisonous.</p>

<p>In the smelting of lead ore into pig lead, 15 per cent. goes off in
fumes, and 10 per cent. are all that it has hitherto been found possible
to recover; by this process, however, the whole 15 per cent. are
recovered. The sulphate may also be produced from a low quality of
galena, or lead ore, which is not suited for smelting into metallic
lead, and from the slag formed in the process of smelting.</p>

<p>The plant consists of simple subliming furnaces, iron cooling pipes,
suction fans, and a series of flannel or calico bags, arranged
vertically in a building, well ventilated, so as to allow the filtered
gases to escape, leaving behind the sublimed white lead, which is then
merely shaken down from the bags into barrels placed beneath them. The
manufacture is carried on at Joplin, Missouri, with four subliming
furnaces, about 500 feet of cooling pipes and towers, with suction fans,
which drive the fumes into 300 bags, 20 inches in diameter, and 38 feet
long, arranged vertically. About 50 tons weekly of white lead are now
being produced from waste fumes, slag, and poor ore, by this
establishment alone, at a cost not exceeding that given in the following
figures:&mdash;</p>

<p>Freeman’s process (see <a href="#Page_254">p. 254</a>) consists of grinding together, in a dry
state, under great pressure, and consequently with great friction,
sulphate of lead and sulphate of zinc. While neither of these two
substances alone possesses good body or opacity, when treated by this
process they are so changed in character that the new substance is
stated to be superior in these respects to the best form of ordinary
white lead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>The white lead thus obtained mixes well with oil, and has also the
advantage of not becoming blackened when exposed to the fumes of
sulphuretted hydrogen, and of not peeling off in a saline atmosphere. As
a basis for coloured paints, it is recommended on the ground that, being
decomposed with greater difficulty, it can be mixed with almost any
colouring substance; and, being free from acid, it does not change the
tints of other substances.</p>

<p>The details of Lewis’s process, and the plant employed, are more fully
set forth below.</p>

<p>Heretofore the manufacture of dry white lead from galena or the native
sulphurets has been effected by roasting or desulphurising the galena,
and then mixing the residue, after roasting, with carbon, and subjecting
the mixture to the action of heat in a compound reducing or subliming
and oxidising furnace, and collecting the resulting fumes in textile
bags.</p>

<p>Lewis’s process, however, is based upon the discovery that by subliming
unroasted galena, or the native or raw sulphuret of lead, and then
oxidising the volatile products, cooling the fumes, and collecting them
by means of a textile fabric, a superior basis of a pigment can be
obtained. The admixture of carbon with the raw ore will facilitate the
subliming process, or it may be carried on in a muffle or reverberatory
furnace without the previous admixture of carbon.</p>

<p>The furnace, which has been found to answer well for the purposes above
mentioned, is commonly known as the Wetherill furnace, and is
represented in plan, in <a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a>; in front and back elevations, in Figs.
<a href="#fig_22">22</a>, <a href="#fig_23">23</a>; and in central longitudinal section, in <a href="#fig_24">Fig. 24</a>.</p>

<p class="nind">the escape of the crushed ore and coal. These perforated bars are
suitably sustained at the ends on the front and back walls of the
furnace. The ash pit below the perforated bottom is of equal area
therewith, and is provided with a door <i>e</i> in front, and with a hole <i>f</i>
at the back for the reception of a pipe from suitable blowing apparatus.</p>

<p>The walls <i>g</i>, and arch on the top should be built of some refractory
substance, such as fire-brick.</p>

<p>The front of the furnace is entirely open, and is provided with sliding
doors <i>i</i>, by which it can be closed when working, and opened to remove
the residuum.</p>

<p>At the back of the furnace there are two slides <i>j</i>, to permit access to
the main chamber, for stirring the charge and for inspection.</p>

<p>At the back, near the arch, there is a hole <i>k</i>, governed by a sliding
damper leading to a chimney, for carrying off smoke and impure gases at
the commencement of the operation upon a new charge.</p>

<p>In the centre of the roof there is an aperture <i>l</i>, governed by a damper
or sliding door <i>m</i>, the said aperture leading to a suitable apparatus
for the collection of the oxidised vapours of lead.</p>

<p>The exterior walls <i>n o p q</i> may be built up to form two feeding troughs
<i>r</i>, one on each side of the arch or roof, and each provided with an
aperture or passage <i>s</i>, communicating with the inside or main chamber,
and each aperture or passage is provided with a cover to be put on after
the furnace has been charged.</p>

<p>In working with this furnace, crushed ore (native sulphuret of lead) and
carbon, preferably in the state of pea or dust anthracite coal, are
mixed in equal proportions; the mixture is ignited, and the fumes are
oxidised by the blast through the mixture, which also promotes the
combustion. Dense white vapours or fumes pass off, and are conveyed to a
separate chamber, where they are strained by passing through a screen or
series of screens of muslin or other tex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>tile fabric. Lime may also be
employed in the furnace, in the proportion of 200 lb. of lime to 400 lb.
of galena, although the addition of the lime is not necessary in all
cases.</p>

<p>Instead of the furnace above described, a muffle furnace may be
employed, in which the heat is applied indirectly to the ore, with the
precaution of constructing the sole or bottom of this furnace of a
material not rapidly acted on by the constituents of the ore; or a
reverberatory furnace may be used in which the heat is directly applied.
In both of these two cases reducing carbon may or may not be mixed with
the ore.</p>

<p>Sometimes, generated gas is employed in place of coal, to effect the
same result.</p>

<p>In a later specification Lewis remarks that when white lead pigment is
manufactured from galena or other lead ores, in the raw state, or even
in the roasted state, by subjecting them to the joint action of heat and
air, either with or without reducing means, according to the quality of
the lead ores used, the fumes are discoloured by particles of carbon or
sulphuret of lead, or both, when they are caught in bags of textile
fabric, and are unfit when in this state for use as a white pigment.</p>

<p>The fumes which are produced by this action of heat and air on galena or
other lead ore are cooled and then collected in bags, and Lewis prefers
to expose the so-collected products to the joint action of heat and air,
to destroy or to burn out all the particles of carbon or sulphuret of
lead, or both, by either throwing the said fumes on a bright clean
anthracite or coke fire, with a blast from the sides or from below, or
by throwing them over such fires or into a cupola furnace, or by
throwing or blowing them into a generator gas flame, or through
externally heated retorts. He then in either case collects the escaping
fumes from the furnace or retort in bags or screening chambers.</p>

<p>The best process to be adopted depends upon the kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span> fuel in the
locality where the fumes are refined, and also upon the purity of the
lead fumes. If they contain iron, clay, or the like, it is best to throw
them into a coal fire; but if they are pure, one process is about as
effective as the other, and the degree of purity of the fuel decides the
kind of heating apparatus to be used.</p>

<p>There being such great difference in the purity of fuels, and this
irregularity not allowing of uniform results, Lewis prefers to use a
furnace in which the flame and heat are produced by burning gaseous fuel
with air, which is forced into the furnace with the fumes which have
been collected in a previous process.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_25">Fig. 25</a> represents a furnace which may be advantageously employed for
the purpose when gas is used as fuel.</p>

<p><i>a</i> represents a blower, into which the fumes are fed from the hopper
<i>b</i>. The fumes, being thoroughly mixed with air in this blower, are
forced into a chamber <i>c</i>, and then through a series of tuyeres <i>d</i>. At
the same time, gas from a generator or producer is admitted by the flue
<i>e</i>, and is burned by the incoming blast from the tuyeres <i>d</i>; the
volatile fumes produced in the furnace <i>f</i> pass through it and out of
the flue <i>g</i>, and are collected in bags or screening chambers. By using
gas fuel, which is easily and fully burned, and clean to handle, a fine
white pigment is produced.</p>

<p><i>MacIvor’s Processes.</i>&mdash;The name of MacIvor is a familiar one in
improvements in manufacturing chemistry, and not the least in connection
with the subject of pigments, sometimes in conjunction with other
inventors.</p>

<p>In 1889 MacIvor and others introduced some modifications in the process
of producing white lead or carbonate of lead, by the treatment of oxide
of lead (litharge or massicot) with a solution of acetate of ammonia,
whereby the oxide of lead is transformed into hydrate and acetate, which
are subsequently converted into carbonate of lead by the injection of
carbonic acid. The hydrate and acetate of lead, in presence of free
ammonia formed in the reaction, are quickly decomposed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="fig_25" id="fig_25"></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">the carbonic acid, yielding the final product, namely carbonate of lead,
and re-forming the acetate of ammonia.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which the conversion of oxide of lead into hydrate can
be effected depends upon the strength of the acetate of ammonia solution
employed, that is to say, the weaker the solution the slower will be the
conversion. It has been found that, for commercial purposes, the
solution of acetate of ammonia may be used with advantage of a strength
which need not be more than 25 per cent. nor less than 5 per cent. A
strength of 25 per cent, operates in a comparatively short space of
time; but a strength as low as ½ per cent. will effect the hydration if
there be a sufficient quantity of the weak solution, the lead oxide
being in a fine state of division, and time of no object. This ½ per
cent. strength, however, or any strength below 5 per cent., is not
recommended for commercial purposes, having regard to the time required
for completing the operation.</p>

<p>The conversion of the oxide of lead into the hydrate and acetate of lead
is effected in the cold (heat may be used, but for commercial operation
it is not recommended). The conversion is facilitated by employing a
mechanical arrangement, similar in many respects to that adopted in a
previous specification, but modified by connecting the digesting vat
with a cistern or vat containing acetic acid, whereby any free ammonia
carried over during the operation may be absorbed. Also by introducing
carbonic acid to the mass of hydroxide and acetate of lead formed by the
oxide of lead and acetate of ammonia, either by a series of concentric
rings perforated with small holes in the bottom of the vat itself, or by
passing carbonic acid down a hollow shaft to which are attached
stirrers, and through perforated tubes attached to the blades of the
stirrers, or by any other means that may ensure the thorough saturation
of the hydroxide and acetate of lead so as to form carbonate of lead.</p>

<p>The solution of acetate of ammonia may be recovered from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span> the white
lead, and be repeatedly used, for the conversion of further quantities
of oxide of lead into hydrate and acetate of lead, which hydrate and
acetate are converted into carbonate of lead by the injection of
carbonic acid. Theoretically, a given weight of acetate of ammonia in
solution, used in conjunction with carbonic acid, should be capable of
converting an unlimited quantity of oxide of lead into carbonate of
lead; but during the manufacture of white lead by this process, it may
be reckoned that there will be a loss of ammonia acetate varying with
the strength of the solution employed, but it should not exceed 10 per
cent. on each charge. This loss arises in the washing of the final
product, and through the escape of some ammonia during the process.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_26">Fig. 26</a> is a vertical section of the apparatus employed.</p>

<p><i>a</i> is a vat, which may be made of wood or other material capable of
resisting the chemicals employed; it may conveniently be 6 feet in
diameter and 4 feet deep, and it is provided with a closely fitting
cover, <i>b</i> is a cistern situate at a higher level, and intended to
contain a solution of acetate of ammonia, <i>c</i> is a pipe by which the
solution can be drawn down from the cistern <i>b</i> into the vat <i>a</i>; a cock

man-hole <i>d</i> in the cover of the vat, and the vat contains an agitator
<i>e</i>, with a vertical shaft which can be turned by gearing <i>f</i> as shown,
or the agitator may be driven by any suitable motor. The shaft of the
agitator <i>e</i> is hollow, and pipes <i>g</i>, which stand immediately behind
the stirring tines, are connected with the hollow shaft, to deliver the

coils of pipe laid at the bottom of the vat, and pierced with small
holes. The pipes <i>g</i> are open at their lower ends. <i>h</i> is a cock by
which the liquor can be drawn off from the vat into the receiver <i>i</i>. A

<p class="nind">vat into the washing cisterns <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>. <i>o</i> is a man-hole, which may
be opened to facilitate the emptying of the vat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span> <i>p</i> is a plug which is
removed to let the white lead run out of the vat. <i>r</i> is an ammonia
catch box, charged with acetic acid.</p>

<p>All the metal-work of the apparatus with which the acetate solution
comes into contact should be of such a character as to resist corrosion,
or should be coated with a material capable of withstanding attack by
the chemicals employed in or formed during the process.</p>

<p>The operation is by preference conducted in the following manner, but
the details admit of variation. The charge of monoxide of lead for an
apparatus of the dimensions indicated may weigh about 1120 lb.</p>

<p>The monoxide should be in fine powder, and may be either moist or dry.
Having received this charge, which is introduced by the upper man-hole
<i>d</i>, the vat <i>a</i> is closed, and a solution of acetate of ammonia is let
down upon the charge from the cistern <i>b</i>, or pumped out of the receiver
<i>i</i>. The vat <i>a</i> should be charged with the solution of acetate of
ammonia in the proportion of three parts of said solution to one part of
lead monoxide by weight. It is convenient to employ a solution
containing 5 per cent. of acetate of ammonia, and the quantities above
stated are suited to a solution of this strength; but the strength of
the acetate solution may be varied within wide limits, as hereafter
explained.</p>

<p>The charge of monoxide of lead and acetate of ammonia in the vat should
be kept constantly stirred by the agitator until it becomes whitish in
colour, when it will be found that the monoxide of lead has become
converted into hydrate and acetate. The workman will know that this
change is complete when the reddish or yellowish appearance of the
monoxide of lead disappears, and the mass in the vat becomes whitish in
colour.</p>

<p>The hollow axis of the agitator is connected with a pipe, by which
carbonic acid gas is supplied to it under pressure sufficient to cause
the gas to pass through the contents of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span> vat. This gas escapes at
the lower ends of the pipes <i>g</i>, and ascends through the liquid in which
the hydrate and acetate of lead are held suspended. A free flow of this
gas should be maintained, and some excess allowed to pass away by a pipe
on the cover into the ammonia catch box <i>r</i>. The pipe dips down into the
acetic acid which this box contains, and any ammonia passing off with
the carbonic acid gas is caught by the acid, and forms acetate of
ammonia. When the hydrate and acetate of lead are completely converted
into basic carbonate (and this the workman will know by its changed
appearance), the motion of the agitator is caused to cease, and the
white lead is allowed to settle.</p>

<p>There is a gauge glass on the side of the vat <i>a</i>, and in this glass the
changes of appearance can be recognised by which the workman regulates
the process.</p>

<p>When the white lead is deposited, the liquor is drawn off into the
receiver <i>i</i> by opening the cock <i>h</i>. The plug <i>p</i> is then displaced,
and the white lead is allowed to descend into the washing cistern <i>m</i>.
Below the cock <i>h</i> is another cock or cocks, in order that any further
quantity of liquor may be drawn off into the cistern <i>i</i> if required.
The taper plug <i>p</i> is then raised, by being pushed up from underneath
the vat <i>a</i>, through pipe <i>l</i>.</p>

<p>The white lead requires to be well washed with clean cold water.</p>

<p>When a fresh charge of monoxide of lead has been placed in the vat <i>a</i>,
the liquor is pumped up on to it from the receiver <i>i</i>, and then a
further quantity of solution is drawn from the cistern <i>b</i>, and also
from the ammonia catch box <i>r</i>, until the proper quantity has been
supplied, which is determined by the gauge.</p>

<p>Quite recently, in conjunction with Mr. Watson Smith, Mr. MacIvor has
introduced further improvements in the production of “white lead” or
basic carbonate of lead, by the treatment of oxide of lead (litharge or
“massicot”) with a heated solution of acetate of ammonium, in a closed
vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> (called the digestor), with agitation and under pressure, so
that the oxide of lead is transformed with exceeding rapidity into basic
acetate of lead, chiefly consisting of the tribasic acetate, ammonia
being set free; and the subsequent treatment of the basic acetate thus
obtained, after filtering or otherwise removing insoluble impurities,
and after cooling with carbonic acid gas in a separate vessel (called
the carbonator).</p>

<p>The acetate of ammonium is by preference first charged into the
digestor, and then the oxide of lead (litharge or massicot) in fine
powder, and in the equivalent proportions calculated to be at least
somewhat slightly in excess of the quantity necessary to form with the
acetic acid of the acetate of ammonium the tribasic acetate of lead
Pb(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2 PbO or Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, is
added (this being in allowance for the certain amount of insoluble and
unconvertible matters in the litharge), the acetate of ammonium liquor
of a strength preferably not below 5 per cent., though it may be
stronger, being first, before the addition of the oxide of lead, set in
vigorous agitation and circulation by the pump, and heat having been
applied by means of a steam heater as shown in the drawing and as will
be explained later on.</p>

<p>The digestor is closed, and the temperature rises. As the temperature
rises, and approaches 212° F., and as the pressure, due more especially
to the tension of vapour of ammonia set free during the reaction with
the litharge, increases, so is the rapidity of the conversion of the
oxide into basic acetate increased, and more and more of this basic
acetate becomes dissolved, whilst at or about 212° F. it is entirely in
a state of solution. The degree of heat, or the prolongation of the
heat, depend of course upon the state of dilution of the acetate of
ammonium used. Something more specific will be said later on regarding
this question of degree of heat.</p>

<p>The clear liquor, together with extraneous coloured particles, red lead,
dirt and undissolved matters, is pumped out through a suitable filter to
one of the carbonators, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span> carried en route through a cooling-pipe
system, and being let cool further if necessary in the carbonator
itself. After cooling thoroughly, the cold basic acetate, which may now
have crystallised or separated out more or less, according to the
strength of the solution, is treated with carbonic acid gas, whereby the
basic acetate, in the presence of the ammonia set free, is converted
into basic carbonate of lead of exceptionally white colour, and with
high basicity and covering power, proper care being taken as specially
indicated later on. There are several reasons why greater whiteness of
the product is secured, the principal one being that filtration from
solid and insoluble coloured impurities has taken place previous to the
carbonating process.</p>

<p>The advantages of the employment of heat and pressure for the formation
of the basic acetate of lead from oxide of lead, and the advantage of
thus carrying out the conversion of oxide into basic acetate of lead
separately from the conversion of that basic acetate of lead into basic
carbonate or white lead, are&mdash;</p>

<p>Firstly&mdash;That separation by filtration from impurities and so forth left
by the oxide of lead used, and insoluble in the acetate of ammonium, is
made possible, and thereby a pigment of exceeding whiteness and purity
can be obtained, besides high basicity, with corresponding body and
covering power.</p>

<p>Secondly&mdash;That the rapidity of the conversion of oxide of lead into
basic acetate of lead is immensely increased&mdash;it becomes in fact almost
instantaneous, much time being saved.</p>

<p>Thirdly&mdash;That the conversion is effected quickly and in a perfectly
closed vessel; no chance of the escape of ammonia occurs, and, in the
carbonating stage of the process, the free ammonia present in the liquid
assists in securing the formation of basic carbonate of lead, and the
maintenance of this basicity throughout the conversion.</p>

<p>This free ammonia is converted by the carbonic acid into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span> the less
volatile but still alkaline carbonate, and, later on, this ammonium
carbonate reacts upon the basic acetate of lead, converting it into
basic carbonate of lead, acetate of ammonium, still less volatile, being
simultaneously produced, ready for use over again.</p>

<p>It must be understood then, that as the carbonic acid passes into and
through the ammoniacal mixture in the carbonator, it continually
precipitates or forms basic carbonate of lead, in presence of more or
less of the volatile alkali, which however continually diminishes in
quantity as the conversion proceeds.</p>

<p>Were no ammonia present, but only tribasic acetate of lead, as in the
case of the earlier methods of precipitating white lead, unless a very
slow current of carbonic acid gas were passed through, some of the first
formed basic carbonate of lead would be in danger of being
over-carbonated and losing its basicity, being converted into
mono-carbonate of lead. This danger is much lessened, and consequently a
much greater possibility of rapidity of carbonating is conferred, in the
case of the process as above described, and by virtue of the ammonia
which is present.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the carbonic acid gas must not be passed, even into the
ammoniacal liquid containing the tribasic acetate of lead, with such
rapidity that distinct alkalinity to the usual tests ceases to be
maintained, and the process must be terminated whilst the liquid is
still alkaline. If a little lead salt on the one hand, and a little
ammonia on the other, be left in the mother liquors ultimately obtained
on filtering from the white lead, they will be returned and circulated.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27</a> shows an elevation (partly in section) of the apparatus
employed.</p>

<p><i>a</i> is an iron vessel made of boiler plate, and lined internally with
lead. It may be here added that all the apparatus is thus lined, or is
constructed of material invulnerable to the action of lead salts,
ammonia, or acetate of ammonia.</p>

<p>The vessel <i>a</i>, which is termed the digestor, should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span> furnished with,
a thermometer, pressure gauge, safety valve, charging hole <i>b</i>, and
suitably arranged sampling pipe with cock.</p>

<p><a name="fig_27" id="fig_27"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 27.&mdash;<span class="smcap">MacIvor’s White Lead Plant.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Agitation of the contents of the vessel is effected by means of the
circulating pump <i>c</i>, which, drawing off supernatant liquor along with
air and ammonia vapour from the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span> part of the digestor <i>a</i>, by the
pipe <i>d</i>, forces it through the pipe <i>e</i> to the heater <i>f</i>, consisting
of a coil suitably heated by steam in a steam vessel <i>g</i>, or by similar
means, and then is forced through a pipe <i>h</i>, leading to the bottom of
the digestor <i>a</i>, where it terminates in a cone-spreader <i>i</i>, provided
with a regulating valve <i>j</i>. By means of this spreader, the liquid is
forced through the heavy and dense mixture containing the oxide of lead,
which it vigorously agitates and keeps more or less in circulation as
indicated.</p>

<p>The charges of litharge and acetate of ammonium will vary according to
the strength of the latter. For a 5 per cent. strength of acetate of
ammonium solution, however, it will be best to calculate the proportions
as follows, viz. about 1200 gallons of 5 per cent. acetate of ammonium
liquor for 1 ton of litharge, which should be finely ground.</p>

<p>The temperature of the liquor may vary between 140° F. and 212° F.; but
within these limits, the lowest temperature consistent with the
sufficiently rapid conversion and solution of the litharge is
preferable. The reason of this is simply that the less the heat
employed, the less is the tension of the ammonia, and the chances of the
loss of ammonia are thus minimised; in addition to this, less delay is
involved and less refrigeration or cooling is needed before carbonating.</p>

<p>The object of the violent agitation of the litharge amongst the heated
acetate of ammonium in the digestor <i>a</i>, is that caking of the former
may be prevented, and a most rapid conversion of the oxide of lead into
basic acetate of lead, with minimum expenditure of heat, be secured.</p>

<p>The effect of the heat in the closed space is greatly aided by that of
the pressure due to the tension of the ammonia and aqueous vapour at the
increasing temperatures.</p>

<p>When the litharge is converted into tribasic acetate of lead, and
brought into solution, the liquor and sludge of insoluble matters is
preferably pumped through pipe <i>k</i>, by means of the filter-press pump
<i>l</i>, and forced through the filter-press <i>m</i>, which removes and retains
the insoluble matter, allowing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> clear liquor to pass to the cooler
<i>n</i>, and through this to the carbonator <i>o</i>, similar in construction to
the digestor <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>Here the cooled liquid is circulated by means of pump <i>p</i> (in a similar
manner to that adopted in the digestor process already described),
carbonic acid being simultaneously pumped in through the pipe <i>q</i>, which
is perforated as shown, or introduced in any other way.</p>

<p>When carbonated to the desired extent, the white magma, consisting of
basic carbonate of lead and mother liquor, is drawn through the pipe
<i>r</i>, by the pump <i>s</i>, into the filter press <i>t</i>.</p>

<p>The clear liquid flows through <i>u</i>, into the covered mother liquor tank
<i>v</i>, whilst the press-cakes of white lead, after sufficient washing with
water, are removed and dried in a suitable manner.</p>

<p>The washings are run off to a weak liquor tank (not shown) for
concentration for use over again. Any inert gases accompanying the
carbonic acid, or the latter alone in excess, pass from the carbonator
through pipe <i>w</i>, into the catch-box or other condensing and absorbing
apparatus <i>x</i>, containing either dilute acetic acid or cold water, in
order to retain any ammonia carried over, and furnished with perforated
trays or baffle-plates.</p>

<p>This catch-box is, if necessary, also connected with a further
condenser, so as to remove all ammonia from the displaced air, or inert
gases (if impure carbonic acid has been used) of the carbonator. It is a
lead lined vessel preferably. The ammonia carried from each charge thus
is tested by measuring the volume of the solution from the catch-box or
other condensing and absorbing apparatus, and estimating the ammonia
present in the solution. This amount of ammonia in a sufficiently
concentrated form is then added to the charge in the carbonator, when
cold, so as to produce a completely neutral solution. The ammonia in the
catch-box is either added to the ammonia stock in the ammonia
department, used for dilution of strong ammonia in making fresh acetate,
or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span> strengthened up to further absorption in the catch-box or condenser,
until strong enough to add to a freshly run and cooled charge in the
carbonator, to replace any ammonia driven off by heat.</p>

<p>The sludge in the filter-press <i>m</i> is washed with water to remove
acetate liquors and ammonia, the weak liquors being run to a separate
closed vessel similar to the carbonator <i>o</i>, but smaller, and not shown
in the drawing.</p>

<p>Here white lead is precipitated by carbonic acid, and the product is
passed into the filter-press <i>t</i>, the weak liquors associated with it
serving to give a preliminary washing to a freshly received charge of
white lead already in the press. The weak filtrate liquors thus obtained
are preferably sent to the weak liquor tank already mentioned, for
subsequent concentration, instead of to the stronger liquor tank <i>v</i>.</p>

<p>The sludge-cakes from the filter-press <i>m</i>, connected with the digestor,
are suitably treated for the recovery of lead therefrom.</p>

<p>The mother liquors contained in tank <i>v</i> from the white lead
filter-press <i>t</i>, are directly returned to the ammonium acetate tank
<i>y</i>, by the pump <i>z</i>, for use over again.</p>

<p>The carbonators may be operated singly as described, or two or three may
be connected together so as to be worked in rotation, the partially
absorbed carbonic acid from one carbonator being completely, or more or
less completely, absorbed in the one, or two, with which it is
connected. The last of such series of carbonators would of course be
connected with the catch-box arrangement previously described, or other
condensing and absorbing apparatus.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;The advantages and disadvantages in the employment of
white lead have been described pretty fully by Prof. Barff in one of the
Cantor series of lectures which form such an important feature in the
publications of the Society of Arts.</p>

<p>Probably the fact that white lead possesses the body it has is the
reason why it has been so largely used, and why so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> many paintings which
have been painted with it have come to a most untimely end. Prof. Barff
says he knows of no pigment so liable to change of colour as white lead.
In saying this he expects that there are many who will not agree with
him. They know that white lead works well and easily, and they like it
because it covers down well; but then he points out some of the great
defects under which it labours.</p>

<p>If you take some oil, and if to that you add lime-water, the oil will
mix with the lime-water, and form a kind of emulsion. Again, if you boil
oil or fat with soda, a kind of soap is formed, and the process of
manufacturing soap is termed the process of saponification. Now if,
instead of boiling fat with soda or alkali, we boil it with plumbic
oxide or oxide of lead, we shall form a soap, and that soap goes by the
name, amongst medical men, of <i>emplastrum plumbi</i>, or lead plaster. This
is a substance made by the saponification of oil with the oxide of lead.
Because this oxide and carbonate of lead have the power of saponifying
oils, you get in white lead that peculiarly smooth easy working which
you do not get with any other white pigment; and it is on this account,
for one reason, that it is liked by artists and painters. Taking a piece
of paper coated with some of this lead plaster, if you throw a light
upon it, you will see that the substance is semi-transparent. This is a
peculiarity of lead that it will saponify and form this sort of
transparent substance.</p>

<p>The famous landscape painter, Mr. Wilson, made an addition to a room in
his house. The old part of the room had been painted a dark colour; the
new part, of course, when it left the workman’s hands, was perfectly
white, and therefore the painters painted down the dark colour with
white lead, until the whole room displayed one uniform tint. After a
while, however, it was found that the part which was originally painted
dark became dark again; the dark paint, in fact, showed through the
white lead. Sometimes, possibly, when an artist wishes to put in figures
upon a dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> background that he has painted, he uses white lead, and the
figures will stand out well and brilliantly at first, but after a time
the dark colour upon which they are painted strikes through the lead,
and the figures of course recede. Now, this striking through is owing to
a slight process of saponification, no doubt owing to an interchange
between the carbonic acid of the lead carbonate and the stearic and
oleic acids of the oil with which the lead is mixed; so that, in time,
the white lead, which has a body which makes it so great a favourite
with artists, loses that body, and becomes a transparent or
semi-transparent substance, something like lead plaster. Here is a
reason why white lead should not be used unless the ground has
previously been brought to a light colour.</p>

<p>There is another objection to the use of white lead, and really a very
valid one it is. Persons go on year after year laying out sums of money
for having their houses painted with white lead, when other pigments
which will keep their colour might well be employed. A house painted
with white lead after some time darkens in tint considerably; the colour
is changed by some influence that is acting upon it through the air, and
that influence is sulphuretted hydrogen gas. If you paint with white
lead doors placed near a drain from which this gas escapes, those doors
will become browned and blackened. White lead is very often,
particularly that procured at ordinary shops, adulterated with a
substance called sulphate of baryta, or, commonly, barytes. This is much
more transparent when ground with oil than white lead itself, and it
will materially impair that property for which white lead is valued,
viz. that of covering down well and solidly. White lead adulterated with
barytes has, generally speaking, a bluish sort of look; it is
semi-transparent. It has not that opacity that pure white lead has. If
you take a small piece of white lead and put it into a test-tube, and
add to it a little nitric acid, or aquafortis, and some water, if the
lead is pure the whole of it will dissolve in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> liquid, and you will
have a pure solution. If it does not dissolve there is a white
precipitate, which will fall down to the bottom of the tube, and that
precipitate is sulphate of baryta. Sulphate of baryta is insoluble in
aquafortis, but carbonate of lead, and most lead salts, are soluble in
it.</p>

<p>There is another excellent test for the purity of white lead, which is
this. If you take a small portion, and grind it up with a little
carbonate of soda into a small pellet about the size of a pea, and then
put it upon a piece of charcoal and hold it in the middle flame of a
blow-pipe for some short time, the sulphate of baryta becomes
decomposed, and you get sulphide of sodium formed. If this sulphide of
sodium be acted upon by an acid liquid, sulphuretted hydrogen is given
off, which could not be formed from carbonate of lead, for in it there
is no sulphur at all; and inasmuch as sulphate of baryta is the impurity
for which we have to look, the presence of sulphide after this treatment
indicates that it was with the white lead which was examined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lime White.</span>&mdash;A name sometimes given to the white pigment prepared from
sulphate of barium. See baryta white, <a href="#Page_170">p. 170.</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lithophone.</span>&mdash;This is a fancy title for one of the several varieties of
white pigment having the metal zinc as a basis, and described under zinc
whites on p. 247.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Magnesite.</span>&mdash;The mineral known by this name is a natural carbonate of
magnesia, just as limestone is a natural carbonate of lime. Where
sufficiently abundant it is quarried, ground, and levigated much in the
same manner as barytes, which it greatly resembles in its qualities as a
pigment, and for which it constitutes a suitable substitute. It is very
white, heavy, and opaque; permanent in ordinary situations; neutral with
other pigments, mixes equally well with oil or water, and possesses good
covering power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mineral White.</span>&mdash;One of the names applied to the pigment prepared from
gypsum, see <a href="#Page_183">p. 183</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orr’s Enamel White.</span>&mdash;A name derived from the maker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span> of a certain variety
of the zinc sulphide pigments, described under zinc whites, p. 254.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris White.</span>&mdash;Another name for the best brands of whiting, see below.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Permanent White.</span>&mdash;This name is often bestowed upon baryta white
(see <a href="#Page_170">p. 170</a>), on account of its durability as compared with white lead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satin White.</span>&mdash;There is a certain amount of confusion in the application
of this term, for while it is sometimes referred to baryta white (p.
170), it is also a synonym for fine gypsum (see <a href="#Page_183">p. 183</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spanish White.</span>&mdash;The most carefully prepared samples of whiting (see
below), are often known by this name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strontia White.</span>&mdash;Though much less common than the closely similar
sulphate of barium, the natural sulphate of strontium is equally
suitable for employment as a pigment, and is prepared in exactly the
same way as baryta white (see <a href="#Page_170">p. 170</a>). The artificial product is also
used. Both possess qualities remarkably akin to those of baryta white.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Terra Alba.</span>&mdash;An old-fashioned name for levigated gypsum (see <a href="#Page_183">p. 183</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whiting.</span>&mdash;This material is simply prepared chalk. It should be soluble
in hydrochloric acid with effervescence, leaving at the most but a small
residue. Sometimes samples of whiting are found which are more or less
alkaline or caustic in their properties. This is a serious defect for
many purposes. It can be detected by treating the sample with water, and
adding to the liquor a little phenolphthalein. If a brilliant red colour
is obtained, caustic lime is present, and the sample should be rejected,
if to be used for mixing with chromes or Brunswick greens, where a
neutral product is required.</p>

<p>Chalk itself is too familiar to need any description beyond saying that
it essentially consists of carbonate of lime, with always a small
percentage of silica associated with it.</p>

<p>Its preparation consists in hand selection to exclude the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span> silica which,
occurs in the more pronounced form of flints, then grinding in several
stages, levigation and drying. The levigation is effected by having a
series of settling pits into which the ground material flows with water,
and deposits according to its degree of fineness. The drying is
performed in chambers provided either with pipes carrying steam or
heated air, or by fires beneath the floor, and thoroughly ventilated so
that the moist air can escape as fast as it is saturated. Finally the
dried whiting is again ground very fine. The drying must be done with
great care and at a low temperature, so as to ensure avoiding
calcination, whereby the carbonate of lime is changed into oxide
(quicklime).</p>

<p>Whiting is a permanent and useful pigment mixed with water in
distempers, but is not applicable as an oil colour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zinc Whites.</span>&mdash;Originally and properly the term zinc white was reserved
for the white pigment consisting of zinc oxide; but latterly many kinds
of white pigment have been introduced containing a large proportion of
sulphide of zinc, sometimes associated with more or less oxide, and
sometimes without any oxide, and these are also by many people called
zinc whites, to which name they are perhaps as well entitled as the
original zinc oxide. It will therefore be convenient to arrange them all
under the same general heading of zinc whites.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Oxide.</i>&mdash;Under the influence of a white heat metallic zinc is
volatilised, and if the vapour is thus brought into contact with oxygen,
either in the pure state or as air, combustion takes place, and the
oxygen unites with the metal to form zinc oxide. On this very simple
principle is based the manufacture of zinc oxide white.</p>

<p>The operation is conducted in plant similar to that shown in <a href="#fig_28">Fig. 28</a>,
which consists essentially of two departments, that in which the zinc is
volatilised and that in which the oxidised vapour is deposited for
collection.</p>

<p>The volatilising process takes place in a series of oblong fire-clay
retorts <i>a</i>, varying somewhat in form but always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> with a contracted and
rising neck. Ordinary dimensions are about 2 feet long and 9 inches in
diameter each way, with walls about 1½ inches thick. These are heated to
whiteness and then charged with ingots of metallic zinc.</p>

<p>The retorts are arranged in double rows in reverberatory furnaces <i>b</i>,
two furnaces being arranged back to back so as to economise heat. The
furnaces are fired at the side, and the heat is conveyed around the
retorts by means of the flues <i>c</i>, the products of combustion of the
fuel finally escaping by the chimney stack <i>d</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>As the vaporised zinc is emitted at the mouths of the retorts <i>a</i> in a
partially ascending current, it immediately encounters a plentiful
supply of air, and thereupon takes fire (undergoes combustion or
oxidation). In this condition it enters the lower and funnel-shaped end
of the sheet-iron flue <i>e</i>, by which it is conveyed into the series of
settling compartments <i>f</i>.</p>

<p>While the bulk of the zinc oxide thus formed passes into the settling
chambers, a portion of it is too heavy to do so; its specific gravity is
such that the force of the draught is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> not sufficient to carry it up.
This portion falls at once into a receptacle placed beneath the mouth of
the flue <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>In order to obtain the necessary draught, the conduits <i>h</i> are open to
the outside atmosphere, and introduce a supply of air just below the
mouths of the retorts <i>a</i>, so that it impinges against the current of
escaping zinc vapour. After passing through the settling chambers <i>f</i>,
the superfluous air finds an outlet at <i>i</i> into a sufficiently capacious
flue <i>k</i>, which communicates with the chimney stack <i>d</i>. Thus the
draught created by the fuel consumed in the reverberatory furnaces is
made to assist the current through the settling chambers.</p>

<p>These settling chambers <i>f</i>, are constructed of wood, and are usually
about three in number, intercommunicating of course. The zinc oxide
enters the first compartment through an aperture in the top of the side
to which the discharge end of the iron flue <i>e</i> is attached. After
traversing the first chamber, the stream of air and such oxide as has
not yet settled passes into the second chamber through the orifice <i>l</i>,
near the bottom of the partition dividing the two chambers. To reach the
next compartment, the stream has to ascend again, the aperture being at
the top of the partition, and this alternation is carried on to the end
of the series, thus checking the through draught and facilitating the
settlement of the zinc oxide. The floors of all the chambers are made
funnel-shaped, with a door at the lowest point, so that the discharge of
their contents may be as automatic as possible. The flue <i>k</i> contains
screens hung at intervals for the purpose of hindering, as far as
possible, the escape of minute particles of zinc oxide into the chimney,
and thence into the outer air, whereby they would be lost.</p>

<p>A description of the process as conducted in Belgium, says that ingot
zinc is placed in a series of retorts within one furnace, and the oxide
is formed in an exhaust chimney, and then passes through a long series
of passages and condensing chambers, in which are ranged tanks of sheet
iron or cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span> to collect deposits. At a certain hour of the day it is
collected into casks, and after being tested as to quality it is ready
for delivery. According to the purity of the metal various qualities are
produced. The best is called “blanc de neige,” or snow white, and is of
a very superior quality; No. 1 white is the most used, the ores for this
quality being selected and purified by remelting; No. 2 white is the
common variety. In the process of manufacture there is more or less
waste material, imperfectly oxidised, deposited in the retorts and
passages. This residuum is carefully ground, washed and dried, and is
employed in painting in the place of lead.</p>

<p>In the American method of making zinc white they use the ore direct.
This is cheaper than the Liège method, but its product is of inferior
quality to that produced by sublimation. There are but two works in
Belgium for making zinc white, the Vieille Montagne Company (at the
Valentine Cocq works), which produce yearly 3000 tons by sublimation;
the other is at Ougree, near Liège, where the American method is
employed, but at present it is idle.</p>

<p>There are many other modifications in detail in different works. One may
be noticed here as it is claimed for it that the pigment is gifted with
greater covering power or body, the limited degree of which is the only
drawback to zinc oxide whites. The plan consists in this, that the oxide
is allowed to collect in the condensing chambers till it is of such a
depth that a man entering stands waist deep in the pigment. The latter
is gathered in pieces of sacking, which are drawn together and squeezed
up tightly, so that the oxide, when newly prepared, is pressed into hard
dense masses.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Sulphide.</i>&mdash;Prof. Phipson, in a paper read before the International
Health Congress, at Paris, remarked that for several years efforts had
been made to discover some white substance to replace white lead for
painting buildings, ships, &amp;c. He himself had devoted several months to
this important subject, but without success. There has been found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> it
is true, in oxide of zinc a substance less poisonous than lead, and
serving very well as a white pigment in oil painting; but its production
is very expensive, and its mechanical properties as a colour in oil are
not pronounced enough to allow it to compete in commerce with white
lead. Such is not the case, however, with an invention of Mr. Thomas
Griffiths, of Liverpool, who has succeeded in obtaining a very
interesting product. This new preparation, which is being manufactured
at the present time on a pretty extensive scale, has for its base
sulphide of zinc (or an oxysulphide of that metal), the properties of
which as an oil colour are of the most remarkable character. It is
prepared by precipitating one of the salts of zinc by a soluble
sulphide, and washing and drying the precipitate. The latter is then
calcined at a red heat, with some precautionary measures, then taken
from the furnace, and, while still warm, thrown into cold water. It is
afterwards levigated and dried. The result is a white pigment, very
fine, and of great beauty. Regarded from a hygienic point of view,
Griffiths’ new white is infinitely superior to white lead, as it also is
in its practical bearing; it possesses no injurious qualities; its
manufacture and use do not affect the health of workmen; its durability
in climates of the most diverse kinds is, so to speak, illimitable; it
is altered neither by gaseous emanations nor by dampness; and its price
is comparatively low. The most remarkable thing about this new white is
that it covers as well as white lead, while it withstands the effects of
all kinds of weather, so that its use is not only deprived of all danger
to health, but it is much more economical than white lead. Prof. Phipson
stated to the Congress that he regarded this new chemical preparation as
being among the most ingenious and useful products that have been
discovered in our time.</p>

<p>A later method, introduced by Griffiths and Cawley, consists in making
an artificial sulphide of zinc by bringing the vapours of zinc and
sulphur into intimate contact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>In carrying out this process, sulphur is melted in a jacket pan heated
preferably by high pressure steam. The melting vessel is connected with
a cast-iron still by means of a jacketed pipe, and the connection is
regulated by means of a valve in the bottom of the melting pan. The
latter should be at such a height above the still that the pressure due
to the column of sulphur in the conduit pipe may be greater than the
tension of the sulphur vapour in the still, so that when the valve is
opened, the sulphur in the melting pans may descend into the still. The
still is kept during the process at a temperature of incipient redness,
so that when the sulphur reaches it, the sulphur is immediately
vaporised and the resulting current of vapour passes to the chamber
described below.</p>

<p>Metallic zinc is melted in a retort or crucible, heated preferably by
means of a furnace on the Siemens or a similar principle, and raised to
such a temperature that it begins to volatilise freely. When this takes
place, the resulting zinc vapour is met by a current of sulphur vapour
obtained as above described, and in excess of that required to form with
the zinc sulphide of zinc. The reaction takes place according to the
chemical equation Zn + S = ZnS.</p>

<p>The sulphide of zinc is in the form of white extremely light powder,
which is carried along by the current of sulphur into the collecting
chamber, such as is used for the manufacture of oxide of zinc. This
allows of the separation of the different constituents of the products
into different qualities; those parts that are carried the farthest are
the whitest and best generally. Those portions nearest to the part of
the apparatus where combination takes place may sometimes contain
metallic zinc, if the sulphur supply has not been carefully attended to,
but this may be separated from the sulphide by levigation.</p>

<p>The collecting apparatus should be kept at a temperature slightly
superior to that of the boiling point of sulphur, in order that sulphur,
which is necessarily in excess, may not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> be deposited with the sulphide
of zinc, but may pass on in the vaporous form to a suitable condenser,
where, after condensation, it may be collected and used again.</p>

<p>Before the sulphur vapour reaches the condenser, the last traces of
sulphide carried along with it are collected by the interposition of
metallic screens or sieves, placed between the sulphur condenser and the
apparatus.</p>

<p>In carrying out the process, care must be taken to keep the collecting
apparatus as cool as possible consistently with the fulfilment of the
conditions above mentioned, viz. that no sulphur be condensed therein.
In practice, this object can be effected with little difficulty.
Impurities in the zinc and sulphur are of little consequence provided
they are not volatile, and not of such a nature that they would detract
from the whiteness of the sulphide of zinc formed.</p>

</div>

<p>The accompanying diagram, <a href="#fig_29">Fig. 29</a>, is given as an example of a plant
that may be employed with good results.</p>

<p><i>a</i> is the sulphur melting pan with its steam jacket <i>b</i>, and steam pipe
<i>c</i>; <i>d</i> is a cast-iron still, arranged within a gas furnace <i>e</i>; <i>f</i> is
a crucible for melting and volatilising zinc, the said crucible being
contained in a gas furnace <i>g</i>; <i>h</i> is an automatic apparatus for
freeing the mouth of the zinc vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> from deposited sulphide of zinc;
<i>i</i> is the collecting apparatus; and <i>k</i>, the condensing apparatus.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Mixtures.</i>&mdash;There are a number of compound pigments commonly known
as zinc whites, which only deserve the name in so far as they contain a
proportion, greater or smaller, of some zinc salt. At the same time it
must be admitted that some of these combinations possess very good
qualities, and that the foreign ingredients largely correct the weak
points of the zinc compounds.</p>

<p>Freeman’s.&mdash;This pigment, when ground with oil in the customary way,
forms a paint equal in body and covering power to the best white lead,
while it is superior in colour, permanence, and density, and is free
from odour and noxious qualities.</p>

<p>It is produced by grinding together “zinc white” (either oxide or
sulphide), lead sulphate and barium sulphate, in certain proportions, in
the dry state, in an edge-runner mill. By thus grinding the several
pigments together, their particles become intimately incorporated and
undergo changes in character. The barium sulphate not only cheapens the
product by reason of its low cost, but also imparts a distinct feature
in rendering the paint more free working. The proportions generally
adopted, calculated by weight, are 5 parts lead sulphate, 2 of zinc
white, and 1 of barium sulphate. The duration of the grinding will
necessarily vary in accordance with various governing conditions, but it
should be continued until the mixture has a density of about 200 lb. per
cubic foot.</p>

<p>Orr’s.&mdash;The pigment known as Orr’s enamel or Charlton white, is a
compound of oxide and sulphide of zinc and sulphate of strontia, or of
baryta. It is prepared in two ways.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Barytes is calcined for some hours at white heat with charcoal,
and the calcined mass is lixiviated with water to wash out the barium
sulphide; to one-half of this solution is added zinc chloride, which
produces a precipitate of zinc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span> sulphide, leaving barium chloride in
solution. To this mixture of zinc sulphide and barium chloride is added
the remaining half of the barium sulphide and some zinc sulphate, the
result of which is a double precipitate of zinc sulphide and barium
sulphate. This is water-washed, filter-pressed, dried, calcined at red
heat, thrown immediately into cold water, ground very fine, and finally
dried.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The second process closely resembles the first, but celestine
takes the place of the barytes.</p>

<p>Either form of Orr’s enamel is a good useful white pigment, very
permanent, mixing well, of excellent covering power, and pure in colour.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Zinc oxide, being an expensive pigment, is liable to
adulteration; fortunately, all such adulterations are easily detected,
and their nature ascertained by a few simple tests. Zinc oxide, if pure,
should dissolve entirely without effervescence in nitric acid; any
residue would indicate adulteration with barytes or china clay; the
former may be distinguished by its weight and the yellowish green colour
it imparts to the Bunsen flame, the latter is lighter and gives no
colour to the Bunsen flame. Boiled with strong sulphuric acid, barytes
is not acted on, while china clay is. If, after cooling, the mass be
diluted with water, and ammonia be added to the liquor, if barytes is
present no precipitate will be obtained, while if china clay is present
a white precipitate is produced.</p>

<p>If the zinc oxide dissolves with effervescence, white lead or whiting
may be present; the solution should give no precipitate of black
sulphide of lead on passing sulphuretted hydrogen through it. On
neutralising the solution in nitric acid with sufficient ammonia, and
adding ammonia sulphide to precipitate all the zinc (the precipitate
should be white, any other colour would show some impurity), filtering
off and adding a little oxalate of ammonia, no white precipitate of
calcium oxalate should be obtained; such a precipitate would show
presence of whiting or gypsum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>The white pigments having as a base the sulphide of zinc, also contain
barytes, oxide of zinc, sulphate of strontium, &amp;c. They can be
distinguished by evolving sulphuretted hydrogen gas, recognisable by its
odour, on treatment with an acid. They are not entirely soluble in
acids, the residue being mostly barytes, but may also be sulphate of
strontium; it is immaterial whether the two be distinguished or not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />
<b>YELLOWS.</b></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> yellow pigments do not form a large or important group, and beyond a
few organic colouring matters which have a limited use in artistic
painting, they are chiefly confined to the ochres of natural origin and
to the chromes, and one or two other kinds artificially prepared from
mineral substances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsenic Yellow.</span>&mdash;Another name for Orpiment (see <a href="#Page_280">p. 280</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aureolin Yellow.</span>&mdash;This colour is prepared by precipitating carbonate of
cobalt from a solution of a cobalt salt with carbonate of potash; this
precipitate is dissolved in acetic acid, and to it is added nitrite of
sodium; nitrite of potassium and cobalt are thrown down as a yellow
powder. Experiments made on the freshly-precipitated colour prepared in
this way, have proved it to be invariably destroyed by caustic potash;
but aureolin yellow prepared in another way, put into a flask with some
caustic soda, has remained unchanged for several days, and proved to be
perfectly stable under this treatment. Samples of the same yellow,
exposed to the action of ammonia, soda, and potash for a considerable
length of time, have not changed. This is really a most important fact,
because aureolin yellow is so beautiful a pigment that one wishes it
would stand for ever. It is, in fresco and silicious painting, a great
desideratum to have colours that will stand the action of lime and
caustic alkalies. Our colours for fresco painting are very limited, and
if aureolin will stand the action of caustic alkalies, it may be safely
used both for fresco and silicious painting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cadmium Yellow.</span>&mdash;The pigment known as cadmium yellow is important on
account of its permanence and brilliance. It is prepared by passing a
stream of sulphuretted hydrogen gas through a slightly acid solution of
a salt of cobalt, usually the nitrate or sulphate, whereby the sulphide
of cadmium is precipitated as an impalpable powder. It is filtered off,
well washed with water, and finally dried at a low temperature.</p>

<p>By this method there is considerable difficulty in producing any
precise, shade of yellow, which is dependent on the proportion of
precipitant used, and can only be controlled after long practical
experience. Therefore some modifications have been introduced with the
object of securing definite tints. The ordinary colour is a pure chrome
yellow. For a lemon-yellow shade, a solution of yellow sulphide of
ammonium is added to one of sulphate of cadmium. For an orange tint, the
cadmium solution (chloride or sulphate) is made very acid by addition of
hydrochloric acid before passing the sulphuretted hydrogen; or the
cadmium solution, as for lemon-yellow, is boiled, and receives the
ammonium sulphide solution while still boiling. But none of these
modifications results in a really durable pigment, on account of the
presence of traces of free sulphur or acid.</p>

<p>The best brands of this pigment being somewhat expensive, there is great
inducement for adulteration, which usually takes the form of orpiment or
of chrome. The former can be detected by the ordinary tests for arsenic,
and the latter by the process described on p. 266.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrome Yellows.</span>&mdash;A very important family of yellow pigments are the
“chromes,” consisting mainly of chromic acid in combination with lead,
iron, or zinc.</p>

<p>Chromates of lead, says Prof. Barff, are produced by precipitating a
lead salt with a salt of chromic acid, and the difference in tint is
owing to the different quantity of the chromic acid which is present in
the salt. The orange chrome is a basic chromate of lead, and basic
chromate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span> lead contains more of the chromic acid than is present in
the lemon chrome. The lightest chrome contains some sulphate of lead
precipitated with the chromate. All these colours contain lead, and are
therefore liable to the influence of sulphuretted hydrogen. Now, if a
chromate of lead is bought hap-hazard anywhere, it may or may not be
pure, but generally speaking, unless the chromates are obtained from
makers who are careful in the preparation of their colours, they contain
many other substances besides chromate of lead. For instance, they
contain a quantity of the solution, in a dry state, from which they have
been precipitated, and are by no means pure. Obviously, also, there is
an inducement to men who sell cheap colours to adulterate them, to bring
them down with whiting, and so forth. In that case the chrome loses its
body; if it is brought down with lead sulphate it has more body; but
when chrome yellows are prepared and mixed with good oils, and put on
carefully, and those oils have time allowed them to become oxidised,
perfectly dry in fact&mdash;not dry in the sense in which an artist considers
a painting dry, but perfectly hard&mdash;then the action of sulphuretted
hydrogen in the atmosphere will not be of such great moment as if the
colours are impure, or if they are submitted to the influence of that
deleterious gas before they have become perfectly hard.</p>

<p>Another objection to the chromes, on the authority of Prof. Barff, is
that they are soluble in alkali, and so are many other colours. If a
painting is painted with chromes, and if that painting be washed with an
alkaline soap, it is quite certain that some of the chromates will be
dissolved. Consequently the minute and delicate touches, upon which the
artist depended for some of the best effects of his picture, are removed
with soap and water. No painting should ever be washed with soap and
water at all; but there are certain colours which will withstand the
action of soap, even if it is intensely alkaline, while others will not.
Taking a precipitate of lemon chrome, if we act upon this with potash
or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span> soda, it dissolves up the yellow precipitate, and destroys it
altogether.</p>

<p>According to Weber, the preparation of chrome yellow presents
difficulties in practice, because products differing in shade and
structure, although of uniform chemical composition, are obtained
according to modifications of the method of manufacture or nature of
materials employed. A special difficulty is the turning of colour,
whereby a “turned” yellow has a dirty orange-yellow colour, which when
mixed with barytes gives a yellowish-brown leather-coloured shade and
not a light pure yellow. Other derived colours are similarly affected.</p>

<p><i>Lead Chromates.</i>&mdash;The acetate and nitrate of lead are the soluble lead
salts generally used. Basic carbonate of lead (white lead) is also much
used, the yellows prepared from this material being cheaper, having a
large covering capacity, and being particularly adapted for ordinary
greens; but these have not the smoothness and lightness so much prized
in some of the yellows obtained from soluble lead salts. The oxide,
sulphate, and chloride of lead have been proposed for the manufacture of
chrome yellow, but their treatment would be very tedious and the
products obtained only of medium quality. In the manufacture of chrome
yellow from acetate of lead and bichromate of potash, different
proportions of these materials are given by different authorities, but
some of these are obviously wrong where an excess of bichromate is to be
used, for every light chrome yellow is liable to turn by the action of
chromic acid or a chromate and thereby become of little value.
Proportions should be used, whereby the acetate of lead remains in
excess, and the reaction should take place in a solution as cold and
dilute as possible. In this way a brilliant yellow tint is obtained.</p>

<p>For the lighter chrome yellows, lead sulphate is precipitated
simultaneously with the chromate by adding sulphuric acid or a soluble
sulphate to the solution of the bichromate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> these yellows have less
tendency to change colour than the pure chromate of lead, if the above
precautions are observed. Chrome yellow, precipitated from an excess of
lead acetate solution, by means of potassium bichromate, corresponds to
the formula PbCrO<sub>4</sub>. When dried it forms light pieces, which show a
conchoidal fracture. A still more voluminous product corresponds to the
formula PbCrO<sub>4</sub>, PbSO<sub>4</sub>. The yellow having the composition
PbCrO<sub>4</sub>, 2PbSO<sub>4</sub>, is very heavy and shows a smooth fracture.
Lightness is often imparted to chrome yellow by the addition of
magnesium carbonate.</p>

<p>Nitrate of lead offers no advantages over the acetate, and is generally
more expensive to use. Free nitric acid is more objectionable than free
acetic acid, because it may act as a solvent on chrome yellow and
liberate free chromic acid, which is liable to “turn” the yellow. When
using lead nitrate it is preferable to neutralise potassium bichromate
with soda, to avoid the presence of free nitric acid. The yellows mostly
in demand are the inferior qualities, prepared by mixing pure chrome
yellows with white mineral matters, generally barytes, gypsum, and
kaolin, usually stirred in with the bichromate solution before adding
the lead salt. Barytes injures the colour least, but kaolin has the
advantage that it does not increase the weight of the colour so much.
Gypsum occupies an intermediate position; it is much more voluminous
than barytes, and does not injure the colour so much as kaolin, but it
is generally used together with barytes. It is not advisable to use this
combination, for the reason that the colour on drying forms very hard
pieces, which offer difficulties in grinding. Gypsum, too, from being
more easily acted on by reagents than barytes or kaolin, tends to take
part in the reaction by decomposing the potassium bichromate before the
addition of the lead salt, and this is objectionable. (Weber.)</p>

<p>A writer in the <i>Chemical Trade Journal</i> gives the following formula for
the production of various yellows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) For soluble lead salts:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary=""
 class="sz90">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class="rt">Kilos.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lead acetate</td><td class="rt">100</td></tr>
<tr><td>Potassium bichromate</td><td class="rt">18</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sulphuric acid (66° B.)</td><td class="rt">12</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This mixture yields a yellow of the formula PbCrO<sub>4</sub>, PbSO<sub>4</sub>. To
obtain good shades, the amount of water employed should not be less than
1000 litres, or double as much with the nitrate. In the latter case, it
is better to neutralise the lead nitrate and to replace the acid by the
sulphate of an alkali or of magnesium, or preferably of aluminium; for
the neutralisation of the bichromate, the best substance is magnesite.
The formula thus becomes&mdash;Lead acetate and bichromate as before;
magnesite, 6 kilos.; aluminium sulphate, 27 kilos.</p>

<p>(2) The Basic Acetate Method.&mdash;Litharge, 76 kilos.; acetic acid (30 per
cent.), 42; bichromate, 21·5; sulphuric acid, 21·5; water, 2000 to 3000
litres. To obtain a denser chrome, 10 kilos. of soda should be added to
the acetate, and 5 of the sulphuric acid replaced by 10 of aluminium
sulphate. For the production of an orange chrome, the following formula
is given: Litharge, 76 kilos.; acetic acid (30 per cent.), 42;
bichromate, 24; Solvay’s soda, 15; and caustic soda (100 per cent.), 5.
Care must be taken that the temperature does not rise sufficiently high
to spoil the shade.</p>

<p>(3) The White Lead Method.&mdash;In this case the white lead must be in the
finest state of subdivision possible, and suspended in the water: White
lead, 100 kilos.; nitric acid (36° B.), 12; bichromate, 13; and
aluminium sulphate, 10: or nitric acid (40° B.), 44; bichromate, 24;
sulphate, 20, the latter giving the more fiery shade. For the production
of an orange: white lead, 100 kilos.; nitric acid (36° B.) 18;
bichromate, 28; and caustic soda, 8, the latter being best added to the
bichromate before precipitation, and the temperature kept between 150°
and 165° F.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) The Basic Chloride Method.&mdash;The same proportions and temperature are
suitable here as in the case of the white lead.</p>

<p>(5) The Sulphate Method.&mdash;Lead sulphate, 100 kilos.; bichromate, 24 to
25; Solvay’s soda, 8·75 to 16; ammonia (24 per cent.), 1 to 2; and
acetic acid (30 per cent.), 5 to 10. The sulphate, in the form of a
cream, is gradually added to the other ingredients after solution.</p>

<p>A new and improved process for manufacturing from galena chemically pure
chrome yellow having great colouring power, according to the <i>Paper
Trade Journal</i>, consists in first dissolving pulverised galena with
nitric acid to produce liquid nitrate of lead, and then precipitating
the chromate of lead by subjecting the nitrate of lead to the action of
bichromate of potash, neutral chromate of potash or chromate of
potash-soda.</p>

<p>The galena (sulphide of lead) is first pulverised by suitable means, and
in case it contains foreign minerals or other impurities, it is washed
or otherwise treated in a suitable manner to remove these substances.
The pulverised galena is then placed in acid-proof vessels and is
dissolved by adding nitric acid diluted with water, the entire mass
being well stirred. A slow dissolving takes place at the ordinary
temperature; but when the mass is heated artificially, either by heating
the vessel, or by using hot water added to the nitric acid, or by the
use of steam, more rapid solution is effected. The product obtained is
nitrate of lead in a liquid state.</p>

<p>The quantity of nitric acid necessary for dissolving a certain quantity
of galena depends on the percentage of lead contained in the ore, and to
a certain extent on the amount and nature of impurities present in it,
and also on the length of time in which the dissolving takes place. In
treating 100 lb. of galena having 80 per cent. of metallic lead, about
90 to 100 lb. of nitric acid of 36° to 38° B. are used, and the nitric
acid is diluted with 100 to 200 lb. of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span> water. This mixture is left for
about 24 to 36 hours, and is stirred up occasionally, as above stated.</p>

<p>After the galena is dissolved by the nitric acid, and the sulphide of
lead is changed into liquid plumbic nitrate, then the sulphur which
floats occasionally on the surface of the solution is removed, and the
substance which remains undissolved is washed out and is also removed.
The liquid nitrate is then passed through filters of felt, linen, hemp,
flannel, &amp;c., or is left standing for about 12 to 18 hours for settling
and clearing.</p>

<p>Now in order to produce the chrome yellow from this nitrate of lead,
bichromate of potash is dissolved in water, and a sufficient quantity of
this solution is poured into the plumbic nitrate solution until all the
plumbic nitrate is changed into chromate of lead, called “chrome
yellow.” Instead of the bichromate of potash, neutral chromate, or
chromate of soda may be used, and for the purpose of obtaining lighter
tints they may be tempered with sulphuric acid or any other compound of
sulphur. The liquid nitrate of lead is placed, preferably, in large open
receptacles of wood, clay, earthenware, or other suitable material, and
the chromate of potash solution is put into similar vessels, and then
placed above the receptacles containing the plumbic nitrate. The
chromate of potash can then easily be run into the lower receptacles
containing the liquid nitrate of lead, and this mixture is constantly
agitated by similar means until all the plumbic nitrate is changed into
chromate of lead, which is precipitated on the bottom of the larger
receptacles.</p>

<p>The chemical action which takes place by this changing of nitrate of
lead into chromate of lead is that the chromic acid of the potash
assumes the place of the nitric acid, which parts from the lead and
combines with the potassium, so that the lead as chromate of lead is
precipitated on the bottom of the receptacle, while the nitric acid of
the plumbic nitrate remains with the potassium, which latter has parted
with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> chromic acid, and a quantity of water as solution above the
chromate of lead.</p>

<p>To change the nitrate of lead recovered out of the 100 lb. of galena
above mentioned into chromate of lead, about 56 lb. of bichromate of
potash are used. This change usually takes place in from about 10 to 30
minutes, after which the chrome yellow (chromate of lead) is left for a
few hours to settle, and then the solution standing on top of the chrome
yellow is drawn off by suitable means, or run out of the vessel by
opening a cock placed above the level of the chromate of lead.</p>

<p>The latter is then washed by adding pure water, which is poured upon the
chrome yellow, and the mixture is stirred up, so that all the remaining
liquid nitrate of potash is removed. After this is accomplished, the
mass is left to settle, and the water is again drawn off from the
precipitate, which then settles on the bottom of the receptacle. This
washing is repeated as often as is deemed necessary.</p>

<p>The chrome yellow is next placed in suitable receptacles, and dried in
the open air or in specially constructed drying rooms, after which it is
packed in boxes, kegs, &amp;c., and is then ready for use. The liquid
nitrate of potassium, or saltpetre lye, removed from the receptacles in
which the chrome yellow is precipitated, and the first water used for
washing the chrome yellow, as above described, are placed in large open
flat receptacles or excavations, so as to be exposed to the action of
the air and sun; or the liquids may be operated on by a small graduation
work, so that a great portion of water evaporates. The residue is then
heated in suitable vessels or troughs by a slow heat until a salt crust
is formed, which, when cooled off and left to dry, is nitrate of
potassium or saltpetre in a pure state.</p>

<p>From 100 lb. of galena having 80 per cent. metallic lead, some 28 to 30
lb. of pure and dry saltpetre are produced by the above described
process. The sulphur produced by the dissolving of the galena by nitric
acid is melted in a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> stove or furnace in the usual manner, and
then refined, so as to produce bars of sulphur called “brimstone.” About
10 lb. of such sulphur are produced from 100 lb. of such galena treated
in the manner described.</p>

<p>The chrome yellow thus produced is said to be chemically pure, and of
great covering power, equal to the best chrome yellow in the market.</p>

<p>The process is very simple, and the crude lead ore is transformed into
chrome yellow in from three to four days.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Pure chromate of lead has an orange-yellow colour, and in
whatever manner it be made it always has this tint. Commercially,
chromes are made of a great variety of tints, from a pale-lemon chrome
to a deep scarlet, through all the intermediate shades of yellows and
oranges; in fact, most colour makers produce not less than eight, and
some more shades of chromes, whence it is obvious that they cannot be
chemically pure, but must be mixed with some other bodies.</p>

<p>In commerce, chromes are distinguished as “pure” and “common”: the
distinction between them is that the “pure” chromes are made from a lead
base, and consist of chromate of lead mixed to a larger or smaller
amount with sulphate of lead, the paler shades containing most of the
latter; while the “common” chromes are mixed with china clay, barytes,
gypsum, or similar bodies.</p>

<p>To distinguish the two kinds of chromes, treat with boiling hydrochloric
acid. If pure, the chrome will completely dissolve, the solution usually
having a green colour. On cooling, crystals of lead chloride separate
out. The liquor will give a white precipitate with barium chloride.</p>

<p>By taking a weighed quantity of chrome, dissolving in hydrochloric acid,
adding excess of barium chloride, filtering, thoroughly washing the
precipitate with <i>boiling</i> water, drying and weighing it, and making the
necessary calculations, every one part of the precipitate being equal
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> 1·3 parts of sulphate of lead, the quantity of the latter in the
chrome is obtained.</p>

<p>The “common” chromes, which mostly contain barytes, are not completely
dissolved on boiling in hydrochloric acid, the barytes they hold being
left as an insoluble residue. By taking a weighed quantity of the
chrome, and filtering off, drying and weighing the residue, the amount
of barytes present can be ascertained; the solution can be tested for
sulphate of lead, which they sometimes contain, as described above.</p>

<p>Chrome yellows and oranges should be assayed for colour and tint, care
being taken to compare them with a thoroughly reliable standard sample.
Their colouring power and body should also be assayed. Another property
which should be tested is the colour that they yield on mixing with
Prussian blue. A great deal of chrome is used for making greens by
mixing with Prussian blue, and as there is a very considerable
difference between them in the shade of green they give, it is rather
important to test this property, which can readily be done by mixing 100
grains of the chrome with 10 grains of Prussian blue, grinding them
together in a mortar, and observing the shade of the green which is
produced thereby; if the green is not bright and pure, the chrome is not
fit to be made into greens, and should be rejected for that purpose.</p>

<p><i>Iron Chromate.</i>&mdash;If a solution of chloride of iron acidulated with
hydrochloric acid be added to neutral chromate of lead, a light orange
powder is precipitated, which is chromate of iron. Dried at 104° F., it
is found to consist of 65 to 65·11 chromic acid, and 34·58 to 34·78
oxide of iron. Chromate of iron is insoluble in water, dissolves easily
in hydrochloric, nitric, and sulphuric acids, and decomposes when mixed
with soda lye. Under strong heat, it melts into a brownish mass. It may
be used in painting in oils, as a substitute for chromate of lead.
Although inferior to the latter in brilliancy, it has certain advantages
over it&mdash;it does not blacken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> with exposure to sulphuretted hydrogen, is
not injurious to the user, and withal is cheaper.</p>

<p><i>Zinc Chromates.</i>&mdash;The before-quoted writer in the <i>Chemical Trade
Journal</i>, speaking of zinc chromates, says that although it is possible
to prepare lead chromates having shades varying imperceptibly from the
palest lemon to a deep granite red, in the case of the zinc compounds
scarcely any variation from the normal is possible, this being, however,
different from anything obtainable with lead. Zinc yellows fall
considerably below the ordinary chromes in their colouring power, but
they are faster in light and are less poisonous. More than 80 per cent.
of the amount annually made in Germany is used for the production of
zinc green by mixing with Prussian blues, of which substance Holland,
Switzerland, and Hungary are the greatest consumers. The zinc yellows
met with in commerce vary in their constitution considerably, being
usually acid chromates of zinc and potassium, basic zinc chromates being
rare. Ordinary salts of zinc invariably contain small amounts of iron,
which must be removed before they are used in the manufacture of
colours. The simplest method is to heat them with the quantity of
permanganate theoretically necessary to convert all the iron present
into the ferric state, adding zinc hydrate, which need not be free from
iron; after thorough stirring, the whole is allowed to settle, and
filtered, when the liquid will be found to contain not a trace of iron.</p>

<p>On the addition of chromate to such solutions, a yellow precipitate
(ZnCrO<sub>4</sub>) falls, but owing to its great solubility in the liquid this
process is valueless. By using an excess of bichromate, the zinc
chromate combines with some of the alkaline salt, forming the compound
(ZnCrO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, which may be washed without loss; but
on drying yields an extremely hard, sandy powder, possessing, in spite
of its fine colour, no value as a pigment. By neutralising the two
solutions before precipitating, a much higher yield of chromate is
obtained, but still so much chromic acid is lost as to make the process
too expensive to pay. Formerly an ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>dition of calcium chloride was made
to the neutral solutions, so as to precipitate as calcium chromate some
of the acid which remained mixed with the zinc salt. The best results,
both in regard to yield and colour, are obtained by adding to the zinc
salt sufficient alkali to decompose one-quarter of it, so that the
chrome may have the formula (ZnCrO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.ZnO. To the bichromate,
enough alkali should also be added to convert it into the normal salt.
It is to be remarked that the nature of the metal combined with the
chromic acid has the greatest influence on the shade of the zinc yellow,
so much so that in manufacturing “acid” zinc yellow, the use of sodium
bichromate is inadmissible. A basic zinc yellow prepared from the sodium
salt has a redder and more cloudy shade than one made from the potassium
compound, but the difference is hardly noticeable when sodium-potassium
chromate is employed.</p>

<p>Modern zinc yellows are invariably prepared from acid solutions, and
consist of a double salt of zinc chromate and potassium bichromate,
mixed with a varying amount of unchanged zinc oxide, which must not be
regarded as an adulteration of the pigment, for its presence gives the
substance “body.” As previously stated, sodium bichromate is
inadmissible, as it does not form similar double salts.</p>

<p>The raw material is usually zinc oxide, which is met with in a state of
great purity; by the addition of sulphuric acid, this is converted into
basic zinc sulphate; potassium bichromate solution is added, and the
whole is stirred vigorously for an hour. At the end of this time, the
zinc chromate, which was previously in a state of partial solution,
begins to separate out in the form of a brilliant yellow scum on the
surface of the liquid, consisting of (ZnCrO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,
while the solution rapidly becomes almost colourless. Suitable
proportions are:&mdash;Zinc oxide, 100 parts; sulphuric acid (66° B.) 60; and
potassium bichromate, 100. Although it is hardly possible that any
hydration takes place, it is found advisable to soak the zinc oxide in
water for 24 hours before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span> the other reagents are added, the sulphuric
acid after dilution being added gradually. Great care must be taken that
the solutions are all cold, and the stirring is continuous, to avoid the
pigment being deposited in a hard sandy form. Zinc yellows thus prepared
are not liable to change during washing in a manner analogous to the
lead compounds.</p>

<p>Zinc chrome is not much used, partly because it is expensive, partly
because it cannot compete with the lead chromes in brilliance, depth of
colour, and body. Still, owing to the fact that it can be mixed with
sulphur pigments without change, it is often employed in the place of
the lead chromes. Pure zinc chrome is completely soluble in sulphuric
acid without any effervescence, but a slight effervescence may be
disregarded. Any residue may be put down as adulteration, and its
character can be ascertained by a few simple tests: it may be chrome
yellow, barytes, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gamboge.</span>&mdash;Gamboge is a product of several trees of Eastern Asia: viz.
<i>Garcinia Morella</i> var. β. <i>pedicellata</i> [<i>G. Hanburyi</i>], a native of
Cambodia, the province of Chantibun in Siam, the islands on the east
coast of the Gulf of Siam, and the south parts of Cochin China; <i>G.
Morella</i>, growing in the moist forests of Ceylon and Southern India; and
<i>G. pictoria</i>, of Southern India, by some considered identical with <i>G.
Morella</i>. <i>G. travancorica</i>, of the southern forests of Travancore and
the Tinnevelly Ghâts, is capable of affording small supplies of the
pigment for local use, but not for export.</p>

<p>When the rainy season has set in, parties of natives start in search of
gamboge-trees, and select those which are sufficiently matured. A spiral
incision is made in the bark on two sides of the tree, and joints of
bamboo are placed at the base of the incision so as to catch the
gum-resin as it exudes with extreme slowness during a period of several
months. It issues as a yellowish fluid, but gradually assumes a viscous
and finally a solid state in the bamboo receptacle. It is very commonly
adulterated with rice-flour and the powdered bark of the tree, but the
latter imparts a greenish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span> tint. Sand is occasionally added. The product
from a good tree may fill three bamboo joints, each 18 to 20 inches long
and 1½ inches in diameter. The trees flourish on both high and low land.
Annual tapping is said to shorten their lives, but if the gum-resin is
only drawn in alternate years, the trees do not seem to suffer, and last
for many years.</p>

<p>Dr. Jamie, of Singapore, who has gamboge-trees growing on his estate,
says that they flourish most luxuriantly in the dense jungles. He
considers the best time for cutting to be February to April. The filled
bamboos are rotated near a fire till the moisture in the gamboge has
evaporated sufficiently to permit the bamboo to be stripped from the
hardened gum-resin. The gamboge is secreted by the tree chiefly in
numerous ducts in the middle layer of the bark, besides a little in the
dotted vessels of the outermost layer of the wood, and in the pith. It
arrives in commerce in the form of cylinders, 4 to 8 inches long and 1
to 2½ inches in diameter, often more or less rendered shapeless. When
good, it is dense, homogeneous, brittle, showing conchoidal fracture,
scarcely translucent, and of rich brownish-orange colour. Inferior
qualities show rough, granular fracture, and brownish hue, and are
sometimes still soft. The pigment consists of a mixture of 15 to 20 per
cent. gum with 85 to 80 per cent. resin. Its chief uses are in
water-colour painting, and in varnishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King’s Yellow.</span>&mdash;A familiar name for the trisulphide of arsenic, also
known as orpiment (see <a href="#Page_280">p. 280</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Naples Yellows.</span>&mdash;This group of pigments embraces several combinations of
the oxides of lead and antimony, derived from various sources, and
prepared by sundry methods. Two of the most useful formulæ are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Mix 3 lb. powdered metallic antimony, 1 lb. oxide of zinc, and 2
lb. red-lead; calcine, grind fine, and fuse in a closed crucible; grind
the fused mass to fine powder, and wash well.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Grind 1 part washed antimony with 2 parts red-lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> to a stiff
paste with water, and expose to red heat for 4 or 5 hours.</p>

<p>There are a great many modifications both in the ingredients and the
processes, and a great variety of shades in consequence.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, the Naples yellows are unsatisfactory pigments, very
prone to deteriorate in impure air, and necessitating great care in
their preparation to avoid contact with iron, which turns them green.
They cover well, are fairly brilliant, and mix readily with water or
oil, but their application is declining rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ochres.</span>&mdash;The large class of mineral pigments known collectively as
ochres or sienna earths possess considerable importance, notably on
account of their remarkable durability and their reasonable price. They
all consist essentially of an earthy base coloured by oxide of iron or
of manganese, or of both. Some authorities differentiate between ochres
and siennas, and ascribe the latter name only to those earths which
contain manganese, but this seems to be an arbitrary proceeding, because
the term sienna, or more properly Siena, is derived solely from the name
of the Italian province in which these minerals are worked. They are of
widespread occurrence, both geographically and geologically, and the
methods of mining and preparing them are not subject to much variation.</p>

<p>Consul Colnaghi, in his report on the mineral products of the province
of Siena, says that Siena earths, known also under the names of ochre,
bole, umber, &amp;c., are considered by some mineralogists to be ferruginous
clays, by others, minerals of iron. They are chiefly found in large
quantities in the communes of Castel del Piano and Arcidosso. The yellow
earths and bole found on the western slopes of Monte Amiata are true
lacustrine deposits found amid the trachytic rocks, of which it is
principally composed. They lie under, and are entirely covered by, the
vegetable soil. Varying in compactness and colour, they are termed
yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span> earths when of a clear ochreous tint, and terra bolare, or bole,
when of a dark chestnut colour. Each deposit consists for the greater
part of yellow earth, beneath which bole is found in strata or small
veins. The mineral being very friable, its excavation is easy, and is
generally conducted in open pits.</p>

<p>The different qualities are separated during the process, the bole,
which has the higher commercial value, being the more carefully treated.
After the first separation the bole is further classed into first,
second, third, and intermediate qualities&mdash;<i>boletta</i>, <i>fascia</i>,
<i>cerchione</i>, &amp;c. Its most important characteristic is termed, in
commercial language, <i>punto di colore</i>, or tint. The value of the bole
rises as its tint deepens. Thus bole of the third quality is lighter
than that of the second, and the second than that of the first. After
the third quality comes the <i>terra guilla</i>. The yellow earths, after
excavation, are exposed to the open air for about a year, by the pit
side, without classification. The bole, on the contrary, is placed in
well-ventilated storehouses to dry for about six months. This diversity
of treatment is owing to the fact that exposure to the elements
brightens the colour of the yellow earths, and raises their value, while
it would damage the bole by turning its darker tint first into an orange
yellow, and, if continued, into an ordinary yellow earth. It also loses
in compactness and crumbles up under exposure.</p>

<p>In addition to the <i>punto di colore</i>, the size of the pieces influences
the commercial value of the bole, which increases with their volume.
Thus the classification is <i>bolo pezzo</i>, <i>bolo grapolino</i>, and <i>bolo
polvere</i>. The yellow earths are classed as <i>giallo in pezzo</i>, <i>giallo
commune</i>, and <i>giallo impalpabile</i>, the impalpable being worth more than
the common yellow. The production of the Siena earths is estimated at
about 600 tons per annum, of which amount about 50 tons are calcined,
and the rest sold in the natural condition. The value of the trade is
estimated at from £4000 to £6000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>The European trade in these earths is very large. Rouen exports some
5000 tons yearly, and Havre about 1500 tons.</p>

<p>Similar deposits occur in America, where they are known as “paint-beds,”
and the earths are called “metallic paints.” A prominent example is the
paint-bed at Lehigh Gap, Carbon County, Pennsylvania, which was
originally opened as an ironstone mine. The mineral proved valueless
metallurgically, but remarkably useful as a pigment, since it contains
about 28 per cent. of hydraulic cement, which hastens the drying and
causes the paint to set without any addition of artificial dryers,
thereby making it eminently fitted for all outdoor application.</p>

<p>Along the outcrop of the paint, the beds are covered by a cap or
overburden of clay, and by the decomposed lower portion of the Marcellus
slate, which is 50 feet thick at the Rutherford shaft.</p>

<p>Beginning with the Marcellus slate, the measures occur in the following
descending order:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Hydraulic cement (probably Upper Helderberg), very hard and
compact.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Blue clay, about 6 inches thick.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Paint-ore, varying from 6 inches to 6 feet in thickness.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Yellow clay, 6 feet thick.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Oriskany sandstone, forming the crest and southern side of the
ridge.</p>

<p>East of the Rutherford shaft the sandstone forms the top-rock of the
bed. This is due to an overthrow occurring between the Rutherford tunnel
and shaft.</p>

<p>The paint-bed is not continuous throughout its extent. It is faulted at
several places; sometimes it is pinched out to a few inches and again
increases in width to 6 feet. A short distance south of Bowman’s there
is a fault striking; north-east in the Marcellus slate, which has
produced a throw of about 200 feet. The measures dip from 10° to 90°.
The dip at the Rutherford shaft is about 79° south, whereas at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span> the
tunnel it is 45° north. The ore is bluish-gray, resembling limestone,
and is very hard and compact. The bed is of a lighter tint, however, in
the upper than in the lower part, and this is probably due to its
containing more hydraulic cement in the upper strata. The paint-ore
contains partings of clay and slate at various places.</p>

<p>At the Rutherford shaft there are fine bands of ore, alternating with
clay and slate, as follows&mdash;Sandstone (hanging-wall), clay, ore, slate,
ore, clay, ore, clay, ore, slate, ore, cement, slate (foot-wall). These
partings, however, are not continuous, but pinch out, leaving the ore
without the admixture of clay and slate. Near the outcrop the bed
becomes brown hematite, due to the leaching out of the lime and to
complete oxidation. Occasionally, streaks of hematite are interleaved
with the paint-ore. In driving up the breasts, towards the outcrop, the
ore is found at the top in rounded, partially oxidised and weathered
masses, called “bombshells,” covered with iron oxide and surrounded by a
bluish clay. In large pieces the ore shows a decided cleavage.</p>

<p>The method used in mining is a variation of panel-work. Nearly the same
system of working is employed by all of the companies who have developed
their mines either by means of tunnels or shafts. Tunnels are preferred
whenever equally convenient, because they involve no expenses for
pumping and hoisting machinery, fuel, repairs to machinery, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following description of the operation of the Rutherford mines is
typical of all the workings in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The Rutherford tunnel is 6 feet high and 600 feet long. The gangways are
driven along the foot-wall of the cement side, 6 feet high, and are
heavily timbered and lagged at the top and on the clay side. The sets of
timbers are 3½ feet apart, and usually of 9-inch timber. The width at
the top is 3½ feet, with a spread of 5 feet at the bottom, the extra
width being cut from the clay. Where the cement-rock is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span> firm, the
collar is hitched 6 inches into it and supported by a leg on the clay
side. The cost of the timber is 54 cents (2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>) per set,
including the lagging. The monkey gangway, which carries the air along
the top of the breast from the air-shaft, is 2½ feet high, 1½ feet wide
at the top, with a spread of 2½ feet at the bottom. Wooden rails with a
gauge of 18 inches are spiked to the cross-ties.</p>

<p>The gangway is not driven continuously, but after being driven about 55
feet on either side of the shaft, the breasts are started 25 feet from
the shaft, a pillar being left to protect it. The breast is then opened
up to the face of the gangway, and when one ore-breast is worked out,
the gangway is driven ahead about 30 feet, and a new breast is opened
and worked out before commencing a third. The air-hole is first driven
to the surface, then the breast is opened to its full width of 6 feet.
The thickness of the bed of ore here varies from 4 to 6 feet, depending
upon the thickness of the partings of clay and slate. The clay and slate
are left on the bottom, which is made sloping to allow the ore to roll
down to the shute; this is 6 feet wide and 4 feet long and heavily
timbered. Small props or sprags are hitched into the cement, and wedged
with a lid on the clay side to prevent falls of rock.</p>

<p>The holes are drilled by hand in the clay-partings. They vary in depth
from 1 to 4 feet, and the charge of dynamite is varied correspondingly,
according to the amount of ore it is desired to throw down. The loose
ore is wedged down with crowbars and picks, and is then freed from any
adhering clay and thrown down the shute. It is there loaded into boxes
holding about half a ton each, which are pushed to the shaft on a truck.
The ore-boxes have four rings at the corners, to which are attached four
chains, suspended from the wire hoisting-rope. At the top of the shaft
the boxes are detached and placed on a truck, which is run to the dump.
Thirty cars, averaging 15 tons, are extracted in a day of two shifts,
the day-shift working nine hours and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span> night-shift eleven. The pay of
the miners is 5<i>s.</i> per shift. The cost of mining the ore averages 7<i>s.</i>
per ton.</p>

<p>The ore, as it comes from the mines, is free from refuse, great care
having been taken to separate slate and clay from it in the working
places. It is hauled in 2-ton wagons to kilns, which are situated on a
hill-side for convenience in charging. The platform upon which the ore
is dumped is built from the top of the kiln to the side of the hill. The
ore is first spalled to fist-size and freed from slate, and is then
carried in buggies to the charging-hole of the kiln.</p>

<p>The slate, when burned, has a light yellowish colour, which would change
the colour of the product. <a href="#fig_30">Figs. 30 to 32</a> represent a front elevation of
the kiln and two sections at right angles to each other. The kiln is 22
feet high and 16 feet square on the outside. The interior is
cylindrical, 5 feet in diameter, with a fire-brick lining <i>a</i> of the
best quality. The interior lining slopes from the fire-place <i>b</i> to the
door <i>c</i>, by which the charges are withdrawn; this facilitates the
removal of the calcined ore. The casing <i>d</i> is of sandstone, 5½ feet
thick, and tied together with the best white-oak timber <i>e</i>. When
charged, a kiln holds 16 tons of ore, and the kiln is kept constantly
full. The heat passes from the fire-places <i>b</i>&mdash;of which there are two,
placed diametrically opposite each other&mdash;through a checker-work <i>f</i> of
brick into the centre of the charge. The charge enters at <i>g</i> and is
withdrawn by a door <i>c</i> in the front wall, 2 feet long and 18 inches
high. The ashpit is at <i>i</i>. The fire is kept at a cherry-red heat, and
about one cord of wood is burned every twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The kiln works continuously, calcined ore being withdrawn and fresh
charges made without interruption. The ore is subjected for forty-eight
hours to the heat, which expels the moisture, sulphur and
carbon-dioxide. About 1½ tons of calcined ore are withdrawn every three
hours during the day. The outside of the lumps of calcined ore has a
light brown colour, while the interior shows upon fracture a darker
brown. Great care is necessary to regulate the heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

black scoriaceous appearance, and is unfit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span> for the manufacture of
metallic paint, as it is extremely hard to grind.</p>

<p>The calcined ore is carried from the kiln in wagons to the mill, where
it is broken to the size of grains of corn in a rotating crusher. The
broken ore is carried by elevators to the stock-bins at the top of the
building, and thence by shutes to the hoppers of the mills, which grind
it to the necessary degree of fineness. Elevators again carry it to the
packing-machine by a spout, and it is packed into barrels holding 500,
300, or 100 lb. each.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Ochres owe their colour to hydrated oxide of iron,
besides which body they contain clayey matter (silicate of alumina),
earthy matters, barytes, carbonate and sulphate of calcium, &amp;c.,
dependent upon the locality from whence they are obtained; thus
Derbyshire ochres contain mostly calcareous earthy matters, barytes,
gypsum, &amp;c., while Oxford ochres and French ochres contain clayey
matter; Welsh ochres are variable, and usually contain a good deal of
silicious matter.</p>

<p>Crude ochres should first be assayed for actual colouring matter and
grit or refuse. This can be done by a kind of levigation method: 200
grains of the crude ochre are crushed in a mortar; the grinding must not
be too well done, or otherwise faulty results will be obtained. The
crushed ochre is put into a tall conical glass; a long glass funnel
passes to the bottom of the glass, and the whole is arranged in a large
glass basin or dish. A current of water is now caused to flow down the
glass funnel; this washes the fine particles of ochre away from the
grit, and they are carried over the sides of the glass into the dish.
Here they are allowed to settle, and are collected and weighed after
drying, an operation which gives the amount of ochre in the crude
material.</p>

<p>Levigated and prepared ochres can be tested for colour and covering
power, by the usual methods. These are the most important points about
ochres to which attention should be paid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orpiment.</span>&mdash;Orpiment, king’s yellow, or trisulphide of arsenic, is a
lemon or orange-yellow coloured substance, found native in Hungary, the
Hartz, and other places. The finest samples used by artists (golden
orpiment) come from Persia. The commercial article is artificially
prepared for use as a pigment in the following way:&mdash;</p>

<p>A mixture of arsenious acid and sulphur is placed in an iron
subliming-pot, similar to those used in the preparation of crude white
arsenic. The mixture is then heated until the sublimate which
immediately forms upon the rings fixed above the pot begins to melt. The
proportions of the two ingredients used vary largely, the best colours
being probably produced when the mixture contains from one-third to
one-fifth of sulphur; for the lighter colours, a smaller proportion of
sulphur is employed. Orpiment made in this manner consists of a
mechanical mixture of sulphide and oxide of arsenic.</p>

<p>Orpiment is also employed as a dye, in the preparation of fireworks, and
in some depilatories. The native sulphide is preferred to the artificial
variety by artists and dyers, by reason of its richer colour; but it is
a colour which in reality is hardly ever used now. Sometimes it is
employed in water-colours, but as a pigment it is worthless. If it comes
in contact with white lead it is decomposed in time, and a brown or
black sulphide of lead is formed. While it endures it is a very
brilliant colour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Realgar.</span>&mdash;Realgar or disulphide of arsenic, is a deep orange-red
substance, soluble in water, and highly volatile and poisonous. It is
found native in some volcanic districts, especially in the neighbourhood
of Naples; but the commercial article is made by distilling, in
earthenware retorts, arsenical pyrites, or a mixture of sulphur and
arsenic, or of orpiment and sulphur, or of arsenious acid, sulphur, and
charcoal, in the proper proportions; it has not the brilliant colour of
the native mineral, and is much more poisonous.</p>

<p>On a large scale, the manufacture is carried on in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> following
way:&mdash;The ingredients are mixed together in such proportions that the
mixture shall contain 15 per cent. of arsenic, and from 26 to 28 per
cent. of sulphur, in order to make allowance for the volatilisation of a
portion of the latter substance. The mixture is then placed in a series
of earthenware retorts, which are charged every twelve hours with about
60 lb.; this quantity should fill them three parts full. These are then
gradually heated to redness for from eight to twelve hours, during which
time the realgar distils off, and is collected in earthen receivers,
similar to the retorts, but perforated with small holes to permit the
escape of these gases. After the operation, the receivers are emptied,
and the crude product is remelted. This is performed in cast-iron pots,
the contents being well agitated, and the slag carefully removed. The
requisite amount of sulphur or arsenic is then added, according to the
colour of the mixture, or else a proper quantity of realgar containing
an excess of the required constituent, and the mass is again stirred.
When, on cooling, it exhibits the correct colour and compactness, it is
run off into conical moulds of sheet iron, cooled and broken up; it is
sometimes refined by re-sublimation. The chief use of realgar is as a
pigment; and in pyrotechny in the preparation of white fires.</p>

<p>As a pigment it possesses the same features and faults as its close ally
orpiment.</p>

<b>LAKES.</b></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Organic</span> colouring matters for use as pigments are mostly made in the
form of “lakes,” by one of the three following methods:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) To a filtered solution of the colouring matter is added a solution
of alum; the whole is agitated, and the colour is precipitated by a
solution of carbonate of potash.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A solution of the colouring matter is made in a weak alkaline lye,
and precipitated by adding a solution of alum.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Recently-precipitated alumina is agitated with a solution of the
colouring matter as before, until the liquid is nearly decolorised, or
the alumina assumes a sufficiently deep tint. The first method is
generally adopted for acidulous solutions of colouring matter, or those
injured by alkalies; the second for those not injured by alkalies; the
third, for those whose affinity for gelatinous alumina enables them to
combine with it by mere agitation.</p>

<p>Alumina in a state suitable for the preparation of the pigments known as
“lakes” may be produced in the following manner:&mdash;Dissolve 1 lb. of alum
in ½ gallon of water, and add 75 grains of sulphate of copper, and about
¼ lb. of zinc turnings; leave the mixture for three days in a warm
place, renewing the water lost by evaporation. The copper is first
deposited upon the zinc, the two metals thus forming a voltaic couple
sufficiently strong. Hydrogen is disengaged, sulphate of zinc is formed,
and the alumina gradually separates in the state of a very fine powder;
the action is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> allowed to continue until there is no more alumina left
in solution, or until ammonia ceases to give a precipitate. If the
reaction is prolonged beyond this point, oxide of iron will precipitate
if present. The alumina washes easily, and does not contract upon
drying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brazil-wood Lake.</span>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Digest 1 lb. ground Brazil-wood in 4 gal. water
for 24 hours, boil ½ hour, and add 1½ lb. alum dissolved in a little
water; mix, decant, strain, add ½ lb. tin solution, again mix well, and
filter; to the clear liquid cautiously add a solution of carbonate of
soda while a precipitate forms, avoiding excess; collect, wash, and dry.
The shade will vary according as the precipitate is collected.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Add washed and recently-precipitated alumina to a strong filtered
decoction of Brazil-wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carminated Lake.</span>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) The cochineal residue left in making carmine is
boiled with repeated portions of water till exhausted; the liquor is
mixed with that decanted off the carmine, and at once filtered; some
recently-precipitated alumina is added, and the whole is gently heated,
and well agitated for a short time. As soon as the alumina has absorbed
enough colour, the mixture is allowed to settle, the clear portion is
decanted, and the lake is collected on a filter, washed, and dried. The
decanted liquor, if still coloured, is treated with fresh alumina till
exhausted, and thus a lake of second quality is obtained.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) To the coloured liquor obtained from the carmine and cochineal as
just stated, a solution of alum is added, the filtered liquor is
precipitated with a solution of carbonate of potash, and the lake is
collected and treated as before. The colour is brightened by addition of
tin solution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carmine.</span>&mdash;Boil 1 lb. cochineal and 4 dr. carbonate of potash in 7½ gal.
water for ¼ hour. Remove from the fire, and stir in 8 dr. powdered alum,
and allow to settle for 20 to 30 minutes. Pour the liquid into another
vessel, and mix in a strained solution of 4 dr. isinglass in 1 pint
water; when a skin has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> formed upon the surface, remove from the fire,
stir rapidly, and allow to settle for ½ hour, when the deposited carmine
is carefully collected, drained, and dried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cochineal Lake.</span>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Digest 1 oz. coarsely powdered cochineal in 2½
oz. each water and rectified alcohol for a week; filter, and precipitate
by adding a few drops of tin solution every 2 hours, till the whole of
the colouring matter is thrown down; wash the precipitate in distilled
water, and dry.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Digest powdered cochineal in ammonia water for a week; dilute with
a little water, and add the liquid to a solution of alum as long as any
precipitate (lake) falls.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Boil 1 lb. coarsely powdered cochineal in 2 gal. water for 1 hour;
decant, strain, add solution of 1 lb. cream of tartar, and precipitate
with solution of alum. By adding the alum first and precipitating the
lake with the tartar, the colour is slightly changed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madder Lake.</span>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Tie 2 oz. madder in a cloth, beat it well in a pint
of water in a stone mortar, and repeat the process with about 5 pints of
fresh water till it ceases to yield colour; boil the mixed liquor in an
earthern vessel, pour into a large basin, and add 1 oz. alum dissolved
in 1 pint boiling water; stir well, and gradually pour in 1½ oz. of
strong solution of carbonate of potash; let stand until cold, pour off
the yellow liquor from the top, drain, agitate the residue repeatedly in
1 qt. boiling water, decant, drain, and dry.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Add a little solution of acetate of lead to a decoction of madder,
to throw down the brown colouring matter; filter, add solution of tin or
alum, precipitate with solution of carbonate of soda or potash, and
proceed as before.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Macerate 2 lb. ground madder in 1 gal. water for 10 minutes;
strain and press quite dry; repeat a second and third time, and add to
the mixed liquors ½ lb. alum dissolved in 3 qt. water; heat in
water-bath for 3-4 hours, adding water as it evaporates; filter first
through flannel, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> cold enough through paper; add solution of
carbonate of soda as long as precipitate falls; wash the latter till the
water comes off colourless, and dry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yellow Lakes.</span>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Boil 1 lb. Persian berries, quercitron-bark, or
turmeric, and 1 oz. cream of tartar, in 1 gal. water till reduced to
half; strain the decoction, and precipitate by solution of alum.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Boil 1 lb. of the dyestuff with ½ lb. alum in 1 gal. water, and
precipitate by solution of carbonate of potash.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Boil 4 oz. annatto and 12 oz. pearlash in 1 gal. water for ½ hour;
strain, precipitate by adding 1 lb. alum dissolved in 1 gal. water till
it ceases to produce effervescence or a precipitate; strain and dry.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br /><br />
<b>LUMINOUS PAINTS.</b></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> luminosity of minerals has an obvious practical value in the case of
such substances as can be conveniently applied in the form of a paint to
surfaces which are alternately exposed to light and darkness, such
exposed surfaces emitting at one time the light which they have absorbed
at another. Familiar illustrations are street plates, buoys, and
interiors of railway carriages having to traverse many tunnels. The
light absorbed may be either daylight or powerful artificial light. With
this object, several compositions are prepared under the generic name of
luminous paints. They are chiefly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Balmain’s.&mdash;This consists of a phosphorescent substance introduced
into ordinary paint. The phosphorescent substance employed for the
purpose is a compound obtained by simply heating together a mixture of
lime and sulphur, or substances containing lime and sulphur, such as
alabaster, gypsum, &amp;c., with carbon or other agent, to remove a portion
of the oxygen present; or by heating lime in a vapour containing
sulphur. In applying this phosphorescent powder, the best results are
obtained by mixing it with a colourless varnish made from mastic and
turpentine; drying oils, gums, pastes, sizes, &amp;c., may, however, also be
used.</p>

<p>(2) A French compound.&mdash;100 lb. of a carbonate of lime and phosphate of
lime produced by the calcination of sea-shells, and especially those of
the genus <i>Tridacna</i> and the cuttle-fish bone, intimately mixed with 100
lb. of lime rendered chemically pure by calcination, 25 lb. of calcined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
sea-salt, 25-50 per cent. of the whole mass of sulphur, incorporated by
the process of sublimation, and 3-7 per cent. of colouring matter in the
form of powder composed of monosulphide of calcium, barium, strontium,
uranium, magnesium, aluminium, or other mineral or substance producing
the same physical appearances, <i>i. e.</i> which, after having been
impregnated with light becomes luminous in the dark. After having mixed
these five ingredients intimately, the composition obtained is ready for
use. In certain cases, and more especially for augmenting the intensity
and the duration of the luminous effect of the composition, a sixth
ingredient is added, in the form of phosphorus reduced to powder, which
is obtained from seaweed by the well-known process of calcination. As to
proportion, it is found that the phosphorus contained in a quantity of
seaweed, representing 25 per cent. of the weight of the composition
formed by the five above-named ingredients, gives very good results.</p>

<p>The phosphorescent powder thus obtained and reduced to paste by the
addition of a sufficient quantity of varnish, such as copal, may serve
for illuminating a great number of objects, by arranging it in more or
less thick coatings, or by the application of one or more coatings of
the powder incorporated in the varnish, or by varnishing previously and
sprinkling the dry powder upon the varnish. The amount of powder applied
should not exceed the thickness of a thin sheet of cardboard.</p>

<p>The dry phosphorescent powders are also converted into translucent
flexible sheets of unlimited length, thickness, and width, by mixing
them with about 80 per cent. of their weight of ether and collodion in
equal parts in a close vessel, and rolling the product into sheets, with
which any objects may be covered which are intended to be luminous in
the dark. The powders may also be intimately mixed with stearine,
paraffin, rectified glue, isinglass, water glass, or other transparent
solid matter, in the proportion of 20 to 30 per cent. of the former with
50 to 80 per cent. of either of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span> these substances, and this mass is then
reduced into sheets of variable length, width, and thickness, according
to their intended applications. A luminous glass is also manufactured by
means of the powders, by mixing them in glass in a fused state in the
proportions of 5 to 20 per cent. of the mass of glass. After the
composition has been puddled or mixed, it is converted into different
articles, according to the ordinary processes; or after the manufacture
of an object still warm and plastic, made of ordinary glass, it is
sprinkled with the powders, which latter are then incorporated into the
surface of the article by pressure exerted in the mould, or in any other
suitable way.</p>

<p>It has been observed, after various trials, that the passage of an
electric current through the different compositions augments their
luminous properties or brilliancy to a great extent; this peculiarity is
intended to be utilised in various applications too numerous to
describe, but of which buoys form a good example. The current of
electricity is furnished by plates of zinc and copper mounted on the
buoy itself, when the latter is used at sea; but in rivers and
fresh-water inlets the battery will be carried in the interior of the
buoy. To secure the full effect, 10 to 20 per cent. of fine zinc,
copper, or antimony dust is added to the phosphorescent powder
described.</p>

<p>(3) Take oyster-shells and clean them with warm water; put them into the
fire for ½ hour; at the end of that time take them out and let them
cool. When quite cool, pound them fine, and take away any grey parts, as
they are of no use. Put the powder in a crucible with alternate layers
of flowers of sulphur. Put on the lid, and cement with sand made into a
stiff paste with beer. When dry, put over the fire and bake for an hour.
Wait until quite cold before opening the lid. The product ought to be
white. You must separate all grey parts, as they are not luminous. Make
a sifter in the following manner:&mdash;Take a pot, put a piece of very fine
muslin very loosely across it, tie around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span> with a string, put the powder
into the top, and rake about until only the coarse powder remains; open
the pot, and you will find a very small powder. Mix it into a thin paint
with gum water, as two thin applications are better than one thick one.
This will give paint that will remain luminous far into the night,
provided it is exposed to the light during the day.</p>

<p>(4) Sulphides of calcium, of barium, of strontium, &amp;c., give
phosphorescent powders when duly heated. Each sulphide has a predominant
colour, but the temperature to which it is heated has a modifying effect
on the colour. Calcine in a covered crucible, along with powdered
charcoal, sulphate of lime, sulphate of baryta, or sulphate of strontia;
there is produced in each case a greyish white powder, which, after
exposure to strong light (either sun-light or magnesium light), will be
phosphorescent, the colour depending on the sulphate used and the degree
of heat employed.</p>

<p>(5) Five parts of a luminous sulphide of an alkaline earth, 10 of
fluorspar, cryolite, or other similar fluoride, 1 of barium borate;
powdered, mixed, made into a cream with water, painted on the glass or
stone article, dried, and fired in the usual way for enamels. If the
article contains an oxide of iron, lead, or other metal, it must be
first glazed with ground felspar, silica, lime phosphate, or clay, to
keep the sulphur of the sulphide from combining with the metal. The
result is an enamelled luminous article. (Heaton and Bolas.)</p>

<p>(6) Boil for 1 hour 2¼ oz. caustic lime, recently prepared by calcining
clean white shells at a strong red heat, with 1 oz. pure sulphur
(flowers) and 1 qt. soft water. Set aside in a covered vessel for a few
days; then pour off the liquid, collect the clear orange-coloured
crystals which have deposited, and let them drain and dry on bibulous
paper. Place the dried sulphide in a clean graphite crucible provided
with a cover. Heat for ½ hour at a temperature just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span> short of redness,
then quickly for about 15 minutes at a white heat. Remove cover, and
pack in clay until perfectly cold. A small quantity of pure calcium
fluoride is added to the sulphide before heating it. It may be mixed
with alcoholic copal varnish. (<i>Boston Jl. Chem.</i>)</p>

<p>The luminous calcic sulphide (also called sulphide of calcium), now
obtainable in the market, has a yellowish white tint, which considerably
limits its direct application as a paint. On the other hand, the calcic
sulphide, or the luminous paint obtained therefrom, loses its luminous
property, if it is directly mixed with the ordinary commercial paints.</p>

<p>Schatte, of Dresden, produces durable white or coloured paints,
containing a luminous substance which causes them to shine in the dark,
without changing or neutralising in daylight the tint of the colouring
substance or substances contained in such paints.</p>

<p>For this purpose, Zanzibar or cowrie copal is melted over a charcoal
fire, 15 parts of this melted mass are dissolved in 60 parts of French
turpentine, and the resulting mixture is filtered, whereupon 25 parts of
pure linseed oil are added, which linseed oil has been previously boiled
and allowed to cool a little. The lake varnish thus obtained is
carefully treated in a paint mill with granite rollers, and worked into
a luminous paint by one of the processes hereinafter described.</p>

<p>Iron rollers capable of giving off under great pressure small particles
of iron, which might affect the luminous power, should not be used. Lake
varnish as obtained in commerce contains nearly always lead or
manganese, which would destroy the luminous power of the calcic
sulphide.</p>

<p>The proportions given are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pure White</i>: By mixing 40 parts of lake varnish obtained as described
with 6 parts of prepared baric sulphate, 6 parts of prepared calcic
carbonate, 12 parts of prepared zinc sulphide white, and 36 parts of
calcic sulphide in a luminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span> condition, in an oil vessel, and worked
into a coarse emulsion, which is then ground fine between the rollers.</p>

<p><i>Red</i>: 50 parts of the said lake varnish are mixed with 8 parts of
prepared baric sulphate, 2 parts of prepared madder lake, 6 parts of
prepared realgar (diarsenious disulphide), and 34 parts of calcic
sulphide in a luminous condition, and the mixture is worked in the same
way as described for white.</p>

<p><i>Orange</i>: 46 parts varnish are mixed with 17·5 parts prepared barium
sulphate, 1 part prepared India yellow, 1·5 parts prepared madder lake,
and 38 parts luminous calcium sulphide.</p>

<p><i>Yellow</i>: 48 parts varnish are mixed with 10 parts prepared barium
sulphate, 8 parts barium chromate, and 34 parts luminous calcium
sulphide.</p>

<p><i>Green</i>: 48 parts varnish are mixed with 10 parts prepared barium
sulphate, 8 parts chromium oxide green, and 34 parts luminous calcium

<p><i>Blue</i>: 42 parts varnish, 10·2 parts prepared barium sulphate, 6·4 parts
ultramarine blue, 5·4 parts cobalt blue, and 46 parts luminous calcium
sulphide.</p>

<p><i>Violet</i>: 42 parts varnish, 10·2 parts prepared barium sulphate, 2·8

<p>Luminous colours for artists’ use are prepared by using pure East India
poppy oil, in the same quantity, instead of the varnish, and taking
particular pains to grind the materials as fine as possible.</p>

<p>For luminous oil-colour paints, equal quantities of pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span> linseed oil
are used in the place of the varnish. The linseed oil must be
cold-pressed and thickened by heat.</p>

<p>All the above luminous paints can be used in the manufacture of coloured
papers, &amp;c., if the varnish is altogether omitted, and the dry mixtures
are ground to a paste with water.</p>

<p>The luminous paints can also be used as wax colours for painting on
glass and similar objects, by adding, instead of the varnish, 10 per
cent. more of Japanese wax and one-fourth the quantity of the latter of
olive oil. The wax colours prepared in this way may also be used for
painting upon porcelain, and are then carefully burned without access of
air. Paintings of this kind can also be treated with water glass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br /><br />
<b>EXAMINATION OF PIGMENTS.</b></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Besides</span> the chemical tests for purity and adulteration, which
necessarily must vary with each pigment, there are certain other
examinations which partake rather of a mechanical nature, and which are
applicable to practically all pigments without any modification. They
are directed chiefly to ascertaining fineness, body, colour, and
durability.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fineness.</span>&mdash;Fineness may be tested for as follows:&mdash;A tall glass cylinder
is filled with clean water, and about ½ oz. of the pigment under
examination is well shaken in the water; the glass is placed on one side
to settle out, and the length of time taken to settle may be noted for
future reference. The finer the sample, the longer the time it takes to
settle out; and the time in seconds may be taken as an approximate
estimate of the fineness of the sample.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Body or Covering Power.</span>&mdash;An equal and exact quantity, say 50 gr., of the
sample under examination and of a standard sample of the same degree of
fineness is weighed out, and placed on two separate sheets of paper. To
each sample is added an equal quantity, say 15 gr., of vegetable black
or of very finely ground barytes, according as the pigment is a light or
a dark-tinted kind. The ingredients of each sample are most intimately
and completely mixed, and the tints of the two mixtures are compared by
observation with the naked eye. The pigment which most nearly retains
its own colour, possesses the greatest body or covering power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colour.</span>&mdash;The colour or tint of a pigment can only be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span> estimated by
comparing it with a standard sample; this is done as follows:&mdash;A sheet
of black paper, with, a dead surface, is spread out on a table in front
of a window, a small heap of the standard is placed on the paper, and
next to it a similar heap of the sample to be compared; by means of a
palette knife the surface of the two heaps is flattened out; on now
carefully looking at the two heaps, the one which has the purest colour
can readily be picked out. The heaps should be looked at from several
points of view before a final judgment is arrived at. If the pigment is
dark-coloured, it should be spread on white paper, taking care that the
same kind of paper is used for the two samples.</p>

<p><i>Durability.</i>&mdash;Durability is not a difficult point to test, but it takes
some time to make a complete test. The best method is to mix a small
quantity of the pigment in question with raw linseed oil, cover a piece
of glass with the mixture, and expose it outside to the action of the
sun and air for some time, noting at intervals how it behaves. It is
well for the sake of comparison to coat a second piece of glass with the
mixture, and keep this in a dark place. The difference between the two
from time to time will show how the pigment behaves under the influence
of light and air. As the durability of pigments is decidedly different
according as they are used in oil or water-colour painting, the oil in
the former case acting as a protective agent, it is well to use a
similar test, using a little gum water as a vehicle to mix the pigment
with. It will take from two to three months at least to properly test
the durability of a pigment in summer, while in winter the time will be
increased considerably. Glass is the best substance to use, as it is
quite neutral, and does not of itself introduce into the test any
injurious element, as wood or paper might do, although these bodies may
be used if thought desirable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br /><br />
<b>VEHICLES AND DRYERS.</b></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Paint</span> consists essentially of two parts, the pigment (see <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapters I. to
VIII.</a>), and the vehicle or medium. In the case of oil paints, a third
substance termed a dryer becomes necessary, to facilitate the “drying,”
or solidification of the vehicle.</p>

<p>A perfect vehicle should mix readily with the pigment, forming a mass of
about the consistency of treacle. It should itself be colourless, and
have no chemical action upon the pigments with which it is mixed. When
spread out in a thin layer upon a non-porous substance, it should
solidify, and form a film not liable to subsequent disintegration or
decay, and sufficiently elastic to resist a slight concussion.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we possess no vehicle which complies with all these
conditions; those which most nearly approach them are the drying oils.
Oils are compound bodies containing acids and a base. Some oils oxidise
very rapidly, while others do not oxidise at all. When oils oxidise they
change their colour, and however white they may be at first, they
gradually turn yellow and finally brown. The advantages of oils are that
they mix kindly with most pigments, can be dissolved in turpentine, and
can be used in almost any desired state of fluidity. Against these have
to be set the disadvantage of the oxidation of the oil, to which
oxidation the use of oil in paint is entirely due.</p>

<p>The use of oil in painting is said to have been invented in the 14th
century, and, in a short time, it reached a considerable degree of
perfection. We have only to compare a Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span> Eyck with a painting by a
modern master&mdash;Turner, for instance&mdash;to see that even the best of recent
painters have not succeeded in giving to their works that durability
which the originators of the method attained. All organic substances are
liable to a more or less rapid oxidation, especially if exposed to light
and heat. Oil is no exception to this rule; but it seems that, in its
pure state, it is much more durable than when mixed with other
substances. Although ground-nut-and poppy-oils are sometimes employed by
artists where freedom from colour is essential, yet linseed-oil is the
vehicle of by far the larger proportion of paints used both for artistic
and general purposes.</p>

<p>Oil-paint appears to have been unknown to the ancients, who used various
vehicles, chiefly of animal origin. One of these, which was in high
repute at Rome, was the white of eggs beaten with twigs of the fig-tree.
No doubt the india-rubber contained in the milky juice exuding from the
twigs contributed to the elasticity of the film resulting from the
drying of this vehicle. Pliny was aware of the fact that when glue is
dissolved in vinegar and allowed to dry, it is less soluble than in its
original state. Many suggestions have been made in modern times for
vehicles in which glue or size plays an important part. In order to
render it insoluble, various chemicals have been added to its solution,
such as tannin, alum, and a chromic salt. None of these vehicles,
however useful for special purposes, has become sufficiently well known
to warrant description here.</p>

<p>Substitutes which do claim attention are wax and dammar gum, or paraffin
wax, dissolved in turpentine. The colours must then be ground in
turpentine and not in oil. Such a vehicle is very pleasant to work with,
and gives good results; moreover, it permits alterations or corrections
to be made by rubbing out with turpentine. Nevertheless, both the wax
and the turpentine undergo oxidation to some extent, and are therefore
not altogether free from the same objections as oils. But benzol,
especially when carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span> prepared, answers all the purposes of
turpentine without undergoing oxidation. The only drawback that can be
urged against benzol is its odour, which some people have an aversion
to; but it really has very little smell, and it evaporates away
completely in a very short time. A mixture of wax, dammar, and benzol
forms an excellent vehicle. The wax may be replaced by paraffin wax with
advantage.</p>

<p>It is desirable to be able to ascertain whether the oil intended for use
is, or is not, adulterated with non-drying oil. The distinction of
non-drying oils is that they solidify when acted upon by peroxide of
hydrogen, or by sub-nitrate of mercury&mdash;the oleic acid is concreted, and
a substance called elaidin is formed. This does not take place with the
drying oils.</p>

<p>The oils used in paint making are chiefly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ground-nut Oil.</span>&mdash;The ground-nut or pea-nut (<i>Arachis hypogæa</i>) is very
widely cultivated in the tropics for the sake of its oily seeds. In
Java, the oil is extracted by drying the seeds in the sun, and then
subjecting them to pressure. In European mills, the nuts are first
cleaned, then decorticated and winnowed, by which the kernels are left
perfectly clean. These are crushed like any other oil seed, and put into
bags, which are introduced into cold presses; the expressed oil is
refined by passing through filter-bags. The residual cake is ground very
fine, and pressed under 3 tons to the inch, in the presence of
steam-heat; this affords a second quantity of oil, inferior in quality
to the cold pressed. The usual product is 1 gal. of oil from 1 bush. of
nuts by the cold process, besides the extra yield by the hot pressing.
In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span> France, where the oil is most largely prepared, three expressions
are adopted, as with some sorts of gingelly: the first gives about 18
per cent. of superfine oil, fit for alimentary purposes; the second,
after moistening with cold water, affords 6 per cent. of a fine oil,
suitable for lighting and for woollen-dressing; the third, after
treating with hot water, yields 6 per cent. of <i>rabat</i>, or oil
applicable only to soap-making. In India, the total mean yield is 37 per
cent. at Pondicherry, and 43 in Madras.</p>

<p>The cold-pressed oil is almost colourless, of agreeable faint odour, and
bland olive-like flavour. The best has a sp. gr. of about 0·918, or
0·9163 at 59° F.; it becomes turbid at 37½° F., concretes at 26½°-25°F.,
and hardens at 19½° F. By exposure it changes very slowly, but thickens
with time, and assumes a rancid odour and flavour. It is not a good oil
for paint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hempseed-oil.</span>&mdash;The seeds of the hemp plant, so well-known as a
fibre-producer, are valued for their oil. It is from Russia and Lorraine
that the seed for expressing mostly comes. When the fibrous stems are
tied in bundles, the seed is rudely threshed out, and spread in thin
layers under cover to dry. The extraction of the oil is performed in the
same manner as with other seed oils, described on p. 308. The proportion
of oil contained in the seed is about 34 per cent. on an average; the
yield varies from 25 to 30 per cent. The oil is at first greenish or
brownish-yellow, deepening with exposure to the air; the flavour is
disagreeable, and the odour is mild. It has a sp. gr. of 0·9252 at 59°
F.; it thickens at 5° F., and solidifies at-13° to-18° F.; it dissolves
in 30 parts of cold alcohol and any proportion of boiling; it saponifies
with difficulty, forming a soft soap, but less soft than that from
linseed oil. It is inferior for the painter’s purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kukui or Candle-nut Oil.</span>&mdash;An oil bearing a multitude of names is
obtained from the candle-nut (<i>Aleurites moluccana</i>). It is the most
important product of the tree, and constitutes about two-thirds of the
entire weight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span> kernel of the nut. A great obstacle to its wider
development is the difficulty encountered in extracting the kernels from
the shells, both on account of the extreme hardness of the latter, and
the obstinacy with which the two adhere. Boiling is out of the question,
as the kernels are cooked long before the shells are affected; but there
is every reason to suppose that a slight roasting would have the desired
effect, inasmuch as this plan seems to be adopted successfully by the
Samoans. The weight of the shells necessitates this treatment being
performed on the spot, and, as the kernels quickly become rancid and
dark-coloured after liberation, they must also be operated upon without
removal. The local cheapness of labour is an additional argument in
favour of preparing the oil at the places where the nut grows. The
extraction of the oil is very simple. In Jamaica, Polynesia, and the
East Indies, 50 per cent. is obtained by boiling the kernels in water;
by reducing the kernels to meal, heating in a water-bath, and placing
the mass in bags under hydraulic pressure, the yield is about 60-66 per
cent. The shells are themselves excellent fuel. The oil is completely
clarified by mere filtration. As ordinarily prepared, it is
amber-coloured, tasteless and odourless; slightly viscid at the
temperature of the air in England, congealing at 32° F.; its sp. gr. is
0·923; it is insoluble in alcohol, and saponifies readily, giving a very
soft soda-soap. It dries less rapidly than linseed oil, and is used for
mixing paints and making oil-varnishes. It is said to corrode tin plate
and even platinum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Linseed-oil.</span>&mdash;The flax plant, so well known as yielding a textile fibre,
affords a valuable oil-seed. The supplies of linseed for crushing are
furnished chiefly by Russia and India. It is found that, as a general
rule, the colder the climate in which the seed is grown, the greater are
the drying properties of the oil, but the worse is its colour. In India,
preference is given to white seed, as yielding 2 per cent. more oil,
affording<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span> it more freely, and giving a softer and sweeter cake, than
the red seed; the latter, moreover, always comes to market largely mixed
with rape-seed, which is very difficult of separation, and greatly
depreciates the market value. Oil from unripe seed is watery. The seed
should always be kept for 3-4 months in a dry place, as the oil
furnished after this lapse of time is much more abundant than when the
expression takes place immediately after the harvest. The seed is
crushed and pressed in the manner described on p. 308. The best and
finest oil is that which is “cold-drawn”; it is paler, less odorous, and
less flavoured, but the yield is only 21-22 per cent. of the seed. By
the aid of a temperature not exceeding 200° F., and powerful and
long-continued pressure, as much as 28 per cent. of very good oil can be
obtained. The cake forms a valuable cattle food. The Italian variety is
said to have a much more highly oleaginous seed than the Russian.</p>

<p>Linseed-oil has a faint colour, and mild odour and flavour when pure,
but the commercial article is dark-yellow, with sharp repulsive flavour
and odour. Its sp. gr. is 0·930; at 0° F., a little solid fat separates
out; at-4° F., it solidifies. By exposure to the air, after heating with
oxide of lead, it rapidly dries up to a transparent varnish. The fresh
oil saponifies readily, giving a yellow and very soft soap with soda; by
saponification, it yields 95 per cent. of fatty acids, chiefly linoleic,
with a little oleic, palmitic, and myristic acids. It dissolves in 1·6
parts of ether, and in 32 parts of alcohol at 0·820 sp. gr. The oil is
very extensively used in the manufacture of paint and oil-varnishes. For
artists’ use it is purified by shaking up with whiting, and warming.
Linseed-oil is never met with in commerce really pure, nor even the seed
itself. Previous to the Crimean War, it was a recognised custom at the
Black Sea ports to add one measure of hemp or other seed to every 39 of
linseed. Since then the proportion has advanced to 1 in 19, in addition
to which the Indian seed is grown mostly as a mixed crop with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span> mustard
and colza: pure linseed oil can only be obtained by picking out the
seeds individually.</p>

<p>Linseed-oil, to be suitable for painting, must dry well. A reliable test
is to cover a piece of glass with a film of the raw oil, and to expose
it to a temperature of about 100° F. The time which the film requires to
solidify is a measure of the quality of the oil. If the oil has been
extracted from unripe or impure seed, the surface of the test-glass will
remain “tacky” or sticky for some time, and the same will happen if the
oil under examination has been adulterated with either an animal or
vegetable non-drying oil.</p>

<p>Until recently, linseed oil was frequently adulterated with cotton-seed
oil, extracted from the waste seeds of the cotton plant. Where the
admixture was considerable, it could easily be detected by the sharp,
acrid taste of the cotton-seed oil. Now, however, means have been found
for removing this disagreeable taste, and the consequence has been that
cotton-seed oil is so largely used for adulterating olive-oil, or as a
substitute for it, that its price has risen above that of linseed oil.</p>

<p>Another adulterant which is rather difficult to detect is rosin. Oil
containing this substance is thick, and darker in colour than pure oil.
When the proportion of rosin is considerable, its presence may be
ascertained by heating a film of the oil upon a metallic plate, when the
characteristic smell of burning rosin will be perceptible. When the
percentage of rosin is too small for detection in this manner, a film of
the oil should be spread upon glass and allowed to dry. When quite hard,
the film should be scraped off, and treated with cold turpentine, which
will dissolve any rosin which may be present, without materially
affecting the oxidised oil. The presence of rosin may also be detected
by the following simple chemical test. The oil is boiled for a few
minutes with a small quantity of alcohol (sp. gr. O·9), and is allowed
to stand until the alcohol becomes clear. The supernatant liquid is then
poured off, and treated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span> an alcoholic solution of acetate of lead.
If the oil be pure, there will be but a very slight turbidity, while the
presence of rosin causes a dense flocculent precipitate. Should linseed
oil be adulterated with a non-drying oil, it will remain sticky for
months when spread out in a thin film upon glass or any other
non-absorbent substance.</p>

<p>The sp. gr. of linseed oil is, in some cases, of value in estimating its
quality; but as the variations are slight, it would be difficult to
detect them in so thick a liquid by means of an ordinary hydrometer. A
simple method of obtaining an approximate result is to procure a sample
of oil of known good quality, and to colour it with an aniline dye. A
drop of this tinted oil will, when placed in the oil to be tested,
indicate, by its sinking or swimming, the relative density of the liquid
under examination. Freshly-extracted linseed oil is unfit for making
paint. It contains water and organic impurities, respecting the
composition of which little is known, and which are generally termed
“mucilage.” By storing the oil in tanks for a long time, the water and
the greater part of the impurities are precipitated, forming at the
bottom of the cistern a pasty mass known as “foots.”</p>

<p>To accelerate the purification of the oil, and to remove at least a
portion of the colouring matter, various methods are in use. The action
of sulphuric acid upon linseed-oil is not so favourable as upon other
oils. It is, however, sometimes employed, in the proportion of two parts
of a mixture of equal volumes of commercial sulphuric acid and water to
100 parts of oil. The dilute acid is poured gradually into the oil, and
the mixture is violently agitated for several hours. It is then run into
tanks, and allowed to settle. A concentrated solution of chloride of
zinc has been substituted for sulphuric acid in the proportion of about
1½ per cent. of the weight of the oil. When the reaction is complete,
steam or warm water is admitted into the liquid, in order to clarify it.
Oil treated in this way loses a considerable proportion of the colouring
matter which it originally contained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>When the oil is to be used for white paint, it is sometimes bleached by
exposing it to the action of light. On a large scale, this is done by
placing it in shallow troughs, lined with lead and covered with glass.
The lead itself appears to have some influence upon the bleaching of the
oil, for the decoloration is not so rapid if the troughs be lined with
zinc. For small quantities, a shallow tray of white porcelain or
earthenware, similar to those in use for photographic purposes, gives
very good results, the white surface increasing the photo-chemical
action. It is not quite clear whether the presence of water accelerates
the bleaching of oil by this method; some manufacturers consider its
presence necessary, others omit it. Various salts are added to the
water, the one most in use being copperas.</p>

<p>However the oil may have been prepared, it will, if kept a long time,
deposit a sediment. At first this contains mucilage; but the sediment
from old oil consists chiefly of the products of decomposition of the
oil itself. The presence of oxygen is not necessary for this
decomposition; but it is increased by the action of light. Raw
linseed-oil dries more slowly than boiled; but the resulting film is
more brilliant and durable. Raw and boiled oil are therefore usually
mixed in proportions varying according to the time which can be allowed
for the paint to dry, or to the properties required of the film. For the
ordinary kinds of paint, equal parts of boiled and raw oils are
customary. Linseed-oil heated to a temperature of 350°-400° F. dries
much more rapidly than in its raw state.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menhaden Oil.</span>&mdash;A fish eagerly sought for its oil on the Atlantic coast
of America’ is the “Menhaden” or “porgie” (<i>Alosa [Brevoordia]
Menhaden</i>), a member of the herring family, about 8-14 in. long. The
fishery is carried on all along the coast from Maine to Maryland. The
fish leave the Gulf Stream and strike the coast of New Jersey in April,
reaching the coast of Maine in May-June, and remaining till
October-November. They migrate in enormous schools, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span> are caught in
seines, carried by the fastest and smartest yachts. Very few of the fish
are sent to the table; nearly all are boiled down for their oil.</p>

<p>This is performed in the following manner:&mdash;The fish are shot into
receiving-tanks situated outside the building; thence a sliding door
opens into the boiling-tanks, which are long, watertight, uncovered
boxes, of varying capacity, provided with a coil of perforated pipe for
the admission of steam, and a plug-hole for the exit of the liquid after
boiling. Some water is put into the tanks ready for the fish, and as
soon as the latter have been introduced, steam is turned on, and the
whole mass is boiled for 20-40 minutes. When the cooking is completed,
the liquor, containing a portion of the oil of the fish, is drawn off
into settling tanks, for the recovery of the oil. The “pomace” or cooked
fish is raked into “curbs,” perforated cylinders fitted with hinged
bottoms, and these, when full, are placed under hydraulic presses.
Pressure is applied so long as water and oil continue to escape from the
mass. The remaining solid matters, called “scrap,” are treated for the
preparation of a fertilising compost. The oil and water pass by gutters
into settling tanks, where the oil soon rises to the surface, and is
skimmed off, or allowed to escape over a separating partition.</p>

<p>The oil is still crude, and requires clarifying and bleaching before it
becomes a saleable commodity. This is effected in several ways. It is
first boiled, to free it completely from water. It is purified from
solid matters by running it into filter-bags suspended over casks, and
then subjecting it to pressure in bags, the oil escaping while the
sediment remains in the bags. This refuse, termed “foots,” is bleached
and used for soap-making. The oil thus refined is termed “traits,” and
is ready for barrelling. “Bank” is an inferior grade. Bleaching is
sometimes performed by exposure to the sun in shallow tanks, having
glass covers to exclude dust when a superior quality is desired.</p>

<p>Its principal application in America is for tanning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span> currying
purposes. In France, it is largely employed as a substitute for
cod-liver oil. In this country, it is often passed off as olive-oil, and
considerable quantities of it are mixed with linseed-oil for painters’
use. The rapidity with which it oxidises, and its good body, render it
not unsuitable as a vehicle for paint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Poppy-seed Oils.</span>&mdash;Oil is yielded by the seeds of three kinds of
poppy&mdash;the opium-poppy (<i>Papaver somniferum</i>), the spiny-poppy
(<i>Argemene mexicana</i>), and the yellow-horn poppy (<i>Glaucium luteum</i>).</p>

<p>In Asia Minor and Persia, after the collection of the opium from the
poppy-heads, the latter are gathered, and the seed is shaken out and
preserved. It is black, brown, yellow, or white; some districts produce
more white seed than others. The seed is pressed in wooden lever presses
to extract the oil, which is used by the peasants for culinary and
illuminating purposes. Some of the seed is also sold to Smyrna
merchants, who ship it to Marseilles, where it is employed in
soap-making, and as a substitute for linseed-oil. The average yield of
oil is 35-42 per cent., the white seed being considered the richest.</p>

<p>The same economy takes place in India, where the plant is also grown for
the sake of its seed alone in some districts. In this latter case, the
sowing takes place in March-April, about 2 lb. of seed being sown
broadcast to one acre. The seed vessels ripen in August; the heads are
then cut off, sun-dried, sorted, and trodden out in bags, or threshed.
The seed is immediately crushed and pressed, the yield of oil being in
proportion to the freshness of the seed, and amounting to 14 oz. from 4
lb. under favourable conditions. The oil readily bleaches by exposure to
the sun in shallow vessels, and is then transparent and almost
tasteless. The natives use it very largely for cooking purposes, and as
a lamp-oil. The cake is consumed as food by the poorer classes. The
unpressed seed is largely exported from India.</p>

<p>France grows a large quantity of poppy-seed at home, over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span> 100,000 acres
having been returned as under this crop some few years since. The French
oil is of two kinds, a white cold-drawn oil, and a coarser oil obtained
by a second expression and from inferior seed, the total yield being 40
per cent. The finer oil is fit for alimentary purposes, and is largely
used to adulterate olive-oil; it is also employed as a lamp-oil, and
very extensively by artists for grinding light pigments, as, though
possessing less strength and tenacity than linseed-oil, it keeps its
colour better. The pure oil has a golden-yellow tint and agreeable
flavour; its sp. gr. is 0·924 at 59° F.; it solidifies at 0° F., and
remains long in this state at 28½° F., is slow to become rancid, and
saponifies readily; dissolves in 25 parts cold and 6 parts boiling
alcohol, and dries in the air more rapidly than linseed oil.</p>

<p><i>Glaucium luteum</i> is a common plant on the sandy shores of the
Mediterranean, the western coast of Europe as far as Scandinavia, and
some parts of North America. It is very hardy and cultivated with little
trouble. It prefers stony and chalky soils, where few other plants will
thrive, and has therefore been recommended for culture on such otherwise
waste land. Under cultivation, it affords about 10 bush. of seed per
acre. The seed contains 42½ per cent. of oil, and yields about 32 per
cent. by pressure. The oil obtained by cold expression is devoid of
odour and flavour, and has a sp. gr. of 0·913. It is applicable to
culinary and illuminating purposes, as well as for soap-making and
paint. The cake is a good phosphatic manure. It seems to have been very
little utilised, probably on account of the comparatively small yield of
seed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tobacco-seed Oil.</span>&mdash;The seeds of the tobacco-plant contain about 30 per
cent. of a fatty oil, which is extracted by powdering them, kneading
them into a stiff paste with hot water, and pressing hot. The oil is
clear, limpid, golden-yellow in colour, inodorous, and mild flavoured;
its density is 0·923 at 59° F.; it remains liquid at 6° F., dissolves in
168 parts of alcohol at 0·811 sp. gr., and saponifies readily. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
authority excludes it from the drying oils; another considers its drying
quality to be unusually developed, and recommends it for paints and
varnishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walnut Oil.</span>&mdash;The common walnut (<i>Juglans regia</i>) is found native from
Greece and Asia Minor, over Lebanon and Persia, along the Indu Kush to
the Himalayas, and from the Caucasus almost throughout China, besides
having been introduced generally throughout temperate Europe. In
portions of the Alps and Apennines, it is very abundant, and is fairly
plentiful in the forests of Lazistan, on the Black Sea, but is perhaps
most common in Cashmere, whence come the walnuts imported into the
plains of India.</p>

<p>The albuminous kernel of the walnut affords some 50 per cent. of oil. It
is said that it furnishes one-third of all the oil made in France; it is
extensively prepared in the central and southern departments, notably
Charente, Charente-Inférieure, and Dordogne, where it is commonly met
with in barrels of 50 <i>kilo</i>. In both Spain and Italy, outside the
olive-region, walnut-oil is largely expressed. It is of considerable
importance in the hill districts of India, but is seldom seen in the
plains. Cashmere and Circassia also include it among their industrial
products.</p>

<p>The oil should not be extracted from the nuts until 2-3 months after
they have been gathered. This delay is absolutely necessary to secure an
abundant yield, as the fresh kernel contains only a sort of emulsive
milk, and the oil continues to form after the harvest has taken place;
if too long a period elapse, the oil will be less sweet, and perhaps
even rancid. The kernels are carefully freed from shell and skin, and
crushed into a paste, which is put into bags and submitted to a press;
the first oil which escapes is termed “virgin,” and is reserved for
feeding purposes. The cake is then rubbed down in boiling water, and
pressed anew; the second oil, called “fire-drawn,” is applied to
industrial uses. The exhausted cake forms good cattle-food.</p>

<p>The virgin oil, recently extracted, is fluid, almost colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>less, with a
feeble odour, and not disagreeable flavour. Its sp. gr. is 0·926 at 59°
F., and 0·871 at 201° F.; it thickens to a butter-like consistence at 5°
F., and solidifies to a white mass at-17½° F. In the fresh state, it is
largely used in Nassau, Switzerland, and other countries, as a
substitute for olive-oil in salads, &amp;c., but is scarcely to be
considered as a first-class alimentary oil. The fire-drawn oil is
greenish, caustic, and siccative, surpassing linseed-oil in the last
respect and exhibiting the property more strongly as it becomes more
rancid. On this account it is preferred by many artists before all other
oils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wood-oil or Tung-oil.</span>&mdash;This fatty oil is a product of the so-called “oil
tree” of China, Cochin China, and Japan (<i>Aleurites cordata</i> [<i>Elæococca
vernicia</i>, <i>Dryandra cordata</i>]), and must not be confounded with the
Malayan article, which is an oleo-resin. The fruit capsules of the
<i>t’ung</i> are filled with rich oil-yielding kernels, from which 35 per
cent. by weight of oil may be obtained by simple pressure in the cold.
The sp. gr. of the oil is 0·9362 at 59° F. It possesses several
remarkable properties: heated to 212°-392° F. out of contact with the
air, it retains its original limpidity after cooling, but in contact
with the air it solidifies almost instantaneously, melting again at 93°
F, and exhibiting the same elementary composition; the cold expressed
oil rapidly solidifies by light in the absence of air; and its drying
qualities exceed those of any other known oil. It is devoid of colour,
odour, and flavour. The oil is produced in immense quantities in China;
in the provinces of Ichang and Szechuen, it is one of the principal
articles of native manufacture.</p>

<p>In China the oil is universally employed for caulking and painting junks
and boats, and for varnishing and preserving woodwork of all kinds. The
oil is unknown to European commerce, but an attempt to naturalise the
tree in Algeria has been projected. Its industrial value has been too
long neglected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Extraction of Seed-oils.</span>&mdash;The old-fashioned crude appa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>ratus for
extracting oil from seeds, which answered the purposes of our
forefathers, has had to give way to modern improved machinery, such as
that manufactured by Rose, Downs &amp; Thompson, of Hull, and shown in the
subjoined illustrations.</p>

</div>

<p>The arrangement of the mill is shown in plan in <a href="#fig_33">Fig. 33</a> and in elevation
in <a href="#fig_34">Fig. 34</a>. The seed or other material passes through the following
course:&mdash;It runs from an upper floor through the roll frame A, by which
it is crushed three or four times; it is then taken by the elevators B
to the kettle C, where it is heated and damped. From beneath the kettle,
it is drawn, in quantities sufficient to make a cake, by a box which
conveys it to the moulding machine E. Here it undergoes preliminary
compression, the objects of which are (1) to increase the number of
cakes which may be inserted in the presses at one time, enabling 18
12-lb. cakes to be made where 4 8-lb. cakes were formerly made, and (2)
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span> ensure uniform size and weight, and uniform density or consistence
throughout.</p>

</div>

<p>The cakes are removed from the moulding machine, and put into the press
F, 3 or 4 of which are required to each moulding machine. The pressure
is applied either by means of hydraulic pumps, or by a high and low
pressure accumulator; but unless extreme care is used with the latter,
it gives too rapid a pressure, squirting out the seed at the side of the
plates, and exercising a destructive effect upon the cloth employed. The
pulsation caused by the pumps working directly to the press cylinder is
more akin to the action of a wedge, and seems to extract the oil better
than the dead pressure given by the accumulator. If the latter is used,
a small cylinder may be applied to give the preliminary pressure in the
moulding machine, in lieu of a cam. After remaining under pressure about
25 minutes, the cakes are withdrawn, and after being stripped of the
cloth, are pared by the machine H, which completes the manufacture of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span> cakes. The parings fall under a very small pair of edge-running
stones J, which automatically discharge them when sufficiently ground,
into an elevator conducting to the kettle, where they are worked up with
fresh seed. In a mill with 4 presses, 2 men and a boy in the press room
can make 6 tons of cake in 11 hours, a rate of production requiring 6
men by the old process. The saving in steam power is about 30 per cent.,
chiefly due to the absence of the heavy edge runners, which also effects
an economy of space. About 2 per cent. more oil is extracted, and the
cakes are improved in appearance by not having the structureless texture
caused by the trituration of the seed under edge-runners.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 35.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Seed-crushing Rolls.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Having described the general routine of the process, some details may be
added concerning the working of the several machines. The roll-frame,
<a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a>, consists of 4 or 5 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>chilled-iron rolls, each 3 ft. 6 in. long
by 16 in. in diameter, placed one above the other. These rolls are used
for crushing all the seed that passes through one set of presses, making
5½-6¼ tons linseed-cake per spell of 11 hours. The seed passes into the
hopper in the usual manner, and is distributed to the crushing-rolls by
a fluted feed roll the same length as the crushing-rolls, placed at the
bottom of the hopper. When the seed passes the feed roll, it falls on a
guide-plate that carries it between the 1st and 2nd roll. After passing
between these rolls and being partly crushed, it falls on a guide-plate
on the other side, which carries it back between the 2nd and 3rd rolls,
where it is crushed more fully. It then falls on another guide-plate,
which carries it between the 3rd and 4th rolls, where it is ground more
fully. Then it falls on a 4th guide-plate, and is conveyed between the
4th and 5th rolls to receive the finishing touch. It is thus crushed
four times.</p>

<p>The kettle is shown in <a href="#fig_36">Fig. 36</a>, which represents one capable of heating
sufficient seed to keep four 16-plate presses occupied, or to make 6
tons of cake per 11 hours. It is steam jacketed and furnished inside
with a damping apparatus. The inside diameter is 5 ft., and the depth 2
ft. 6 in. The seed introduced is kept in motion by the stirring gear,
and when sufficiently heated and damped, is withdrawn by the box A in
quantities to form one cake, and transferred at once to the moulding
machine, attached or separate.</p>

<p>This machine is illustrated in Figs. <a href="#fig_37">37</a>, <a href="#fig_38">38</a>. Its purpose is to measure
the quantity of seed required to make each cake, to shape it as
required, and to press it so much, without extracting any oil, as will
enable the greatest number of cakes to be put into the press. The
measure of seed is placed on a strip of woollen cloth, spread upon a
thin iron tray, sliding on the guides B; the bottomless hinged mould C,
having the exact shape of the intended cake, is closed upon it, and the
measure A (<a href="#fig_36">Fig. 36</a>), which is also bottomless, is drawn over guides in
the upper surface of the mould C, thus ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>curately distributing the
seed. The mould is next thrown upon its hinge (<a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>), and the ends of
the strip of cloth are folded over the seed, the thickness of which is
about 3½ in. The thin iron tray, with the mould of seed upon it, is then
pushed along the guides B, beneath the die D. This action gives motion
to a cam, shown above in the illustrations, but which may be placed
beneath if necessary. This cam brings down the die and compresses the
mould of seed to a thickness of 1¼ in.; its revolutions are so timed
that the seed is under pressure long enough (about one-third of a
minute) to let the workman have another cake ready.</p>

3 to 6 an hour, being 4 for cotton-seed and 5 for linseed; most other
seeds are worked the same as linseed, but rape and gingelly are worked
twice. By using 2 presses for the first time and 3 for the second, 3
presses will crush as much seed as 5. These presses are made of a

lb., and requiring 30-45 minutes for the operation. In all these

process, are dispensed with.</p>

<p>A very complete account of oils and fats will be found in Spon’s
‘Encyclopædia of the Industrial Arts,’ to which the reader is referred
for further information.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dryers.</span>&mdash;The maximum of drying power in oils is obtained by the addition
of certain metallic oxides, which not only part with some of their own
oxygen to the oil, but also act as carriers between the atmospheric
oxygen and the heated liquid. This heating of the oil with oxides is
known as boiling, although the liquid is not volatilised without
decomposition, as is the case with water. At about 500° F., bubbles
begin to rise in the oil, producing acrid, white fumes on coming into
contact with the air. The gas thus given off consists chiefly of vapour
of acrolein mingled with carbonic oxide. There is no advantage in
heating the oil to a higher temperature than 350° F. Accurate
experiments have shown that the drying properties of the oil are not
increased by heating it beyond this point, while its colour is
considerably darkened.</p>

<p>For the finer qualities of boiled oils, it is essential that the raw oil
should have been stored for some time, so that it may be free from
mucilage. This mucilage is the chief source of the dark colour of some
boiled oils; when heated, it forms a brown substance, which is soluble
in the oil itself, and extremely difficult to remove.</p>

<p>The oxides usually added to the oil during boiling are litharge or
red-lead, the former being preferred on account of its lower price.
About 2-5 per cent. by weight of the oxides or dryers is gradually
stirred into the oil after it has been slowly raised to a temperature of
about 300° F. The stirring should be continued until the litharge is
dissolved, or it would cake on the bottom of the pan, and cause the oil
to burn. Litharge may even be reduced to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span> cake of metallic lead when
the fire is brisk. Some pans are furnished with stirrers and gearing by
which the latter can be worked, either by hand or steam. The material of
which the pans are made is either wrought or cast iron. Copper pans are
sometimes used with the object of improving the colour of the oil.</p>

<p>Little is known respecting the chemical reactions which take place
during the boiling of oil. Even when the air is excluded during the
process, the drying properties are greatly increased, and, if boiled
long enough, the oil is converted into a solid substance. The loss of
weight which ensues is dependent upon the temperature and the time
during which the operation continues. It is less when the air is freely
admitted than if the pan is covered with a hood. The vapours given off
by the oil are of an extremely irritating character, and should be
destroyed by passing them through a furnace. As their mixture with air
in certain proportions is explosive, this furnace should be situated at
some distance, and the gases be conducted into it by means of an
earthenware pipe.</p>

<p>Since zinc oxide has been introduced as a substitute for white lead in
painting, researches have been made to replace litharge as a dryer,
because it is not logical to discard the lead pigment and then use a
lead dryer with a zinc pigment.</p>

<p>Several metallic oxides and salts, especially zinc sulphate, manganese
oxide, and umber, have the property of combining with oils, which they
render drying. To these may be added the protoxides of the metals of the
third class, i. e. iron, cobalt, and tin. But these oxides are very
unstable and difficult of preparation; hence it became desirable to
discover some means by which they might be combined with bodies which
would enable them to be prepared cheaply, and at the same time leave
unimpaired their desiccating powers. Moreover, it is acknowledged that
dryers in the dry state are preferable in many respects to drying oils.
Following are some of the recently introduced dryers:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cobalt and Manganese Benzoates.</i>&mdash;Benzoic acid is dissolved in boiling
water, the liquid being continually stirred, and neutralised with cobalt
carbonate until effervescence ceases. Excess of carbonate is removed by
filtration, and the liquor is evaporated to dryness. The salt thus
prepared is an amorphous, hard, brownish material, which may be powdered
like rosin, and kept in the pulverulent state in any climate, simply
folded in paper. Painting executed with a paint composed of 3 parts of
this dryer with 1000 of oil and 1200 of zinc-white, dries in 18 to 20
hours. Manganese benzoate is prepared in the same way, substituting
manganese carbonate for that of cobalt. Applied under similar
circumstances, it dries a little more rapidly, and a little less is
required. Urobenzoic (hippuric) acid is equally efficacious.</p>

<p><i>Cobalt and Manganese Borates.</i>&mdash;These salts also, in the same
proportions, are found to be of equal efficacy. The latter is extremely
active, and requires to be used in much smaller proportions.</p>

<p><i>Resinates.</i>&mdash;If an alkaline resinate of potash or soda be dissolved in
hot water, and this solution be precipitated by a solution of a
proportionate quantity of a cobalt or manganese chloride or sulphate, an
amorphous resinate is formed, which, after being collected on cloth
filters, washed, and dried, forms an excellent drier.</p>

<p><i>Zumatic (Transparent) Dryer.</i>&mdash;Take zinc carbonate, 90 lb.; manganese
borate, 10 lb.; linseed-oil, 90 lb. Grind thoroughly, and keep in
bladders or tin tubes; the latter are preferable.</p>

<p><i>Zumatic (Opaque) Dryer.</i>&mdash;Manganese borate, as a dryer, is so energetic
that it is proper to reduce its action in the following way:&mdash;Take
zinc-white, 25 lb.; manganese borate, 1 lb. Mix thoroughly, first by
hand, then in a revolving drum; 1 lb. of this mixed with 20 lb. paint
ensures rapid drying.</p>

<p><i>Manganese Oxide.</i>&mdash;Purified linseed-oil is boiled for 6 or 8<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span> hours,
and to every 100 lb. boiled oil are added 5 lb. of powdered manganese
peroxide, which may be kept suspended in a bag, like litharge. The
liquid is boiled and stirred for 5 or 6 hours more, and then cooled and
filtered. This drying oil is employed in the proportion of 5 to 10 per
cent. of the zinc white.</p>

<p><i>Guynemer’s.</i>&mdash;Take pure manganese sulphate, 1 part; manganese acetate,
1 part; calcined zinc sulphate, 1 part; white zinc oxide, 97 parts.
Grind the sulphates and acetate to impalpable powder, sift through a
metallic sieve. Dust 3 parts of this powder over 97 of zinc oxide,
spread out over a slab or board, thoroughly mix, and grind. The
resulting white powder, mixed in the proportion of ½ or 1 per cent. with
zinc-white, will enormously increase the drying property of this body,
which will become dry in 10 or 12 hours.</p>

<p><i>Manganese Oxalate.</i>&mdash;A writer in the <i>Moniteur de Produits Chimiques</i>
draws attention to the properties possessed by manganese oxalate as a
drier. This salt has hitherto not had any important industrial uses, but
it can be readily prepared in a state of purity from the native
carbonate by the action of oxalic acid; the author is of the opinion
that it will be found of use for this purpose. If prepared from
carbonate free from iron and lime, it can be obtained as a fine
crystalline white powder, and two-fifths per cent. suffices to bring
about the change. The oxalate is resolved by heat into manganese oxide,
carbonic acid and carbon monoxide, and in the presence of fatty acids
the manganese oxide formed combines with them, the decomposition taking
place at about 130°. The operation is carried out by mixing in a mortar
the oxalate with two or three times its weight of oil, and then adding
the mixture to the main portion of the oil. The heat should be applied
gradually, and the decomposition is known to be complete when there is
no further evolution of gas. The boiled oil, under this treatment,
preserves its limpidity and also remains colourless. Manganese oxalate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
has the advantage over oxide of lead, which is commonly employed for
this purpose, in causing the oil to remain transparent when exposed to
sulphur vapours. Manganese acetate has also been used, but it likewise
causes a darkening in the colour of the oil, and the nitrate is
dangerous owing to the possible action of nitric acid on the fats
present in the oil. Manganese borate appears to be next in value to the
oxalate as an oil drier.</p>

<p>In a paper recently read before the Society of Arts, Prof. Hartley
remarked that paint, such as is used for ordinary purposes, is
essentially composed of three materials, without taking into account the
coloured pigments.</p>

<p>(1) White lead, or sublimed zinc-white.</p>

<p>(2) An oil, generally linseed or poppy oil, which is ground up with the
white lead or zinc-white until it becomes a soft paste. This is mixed
with variable preparations of linseed oil and spirit of turpentine.</p>

<p>(3) A substance called dryers, or siccative materials; it may be linseed
oil in which litharge is dissolved, or it may be linseed oil containing
a compound of manganese.</p>

<p>Paint owes to the dryers its property of drying more rapidly than it
would do without it; and it is considered indispensable in buildings in
all cases where paint applied to wood, stone, or metal, would not be
quite dry in 48 hours, or at most in 72 hours, after the first
application.</p>

<p>The first question which requires an answer is, what chemical process
takes place when a paint dries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boiled Oil.</span>&mdash;Linseed oil absorbs oxygen; and, when the oil contains
manganese, it absorbs oxygen much more greedily; and when a manganese
oil&mdash;that is to say, a boiled oil containing manganese&mdash;is mixed with
linseed oil, the substance absorbs oxygen, from a limited supply of air
contained in a closed space, until no trace of any other gas but
nitrogen remains. The power of absorbing oxygen possessed by 100 volumes
of linseed oil, compared with that of 100 volumes of a mixture of
linseed oil and so-called man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>ganese oil, is as 9·4 to 100. This may be
termed the measure of its drying power. A mixture of linseed oil, with a
little more than one-fourth of its volume of manganese oil, has a power
of absorbing oxygen four and a half times greater than either of the
components of the mixture taken separately. In this case Chevreul argues
that linseed oil may be considered as a “dryer” to manganese oil.</p>

<p>Linseed oil, without any addition whatever, if boiled for three hours,
becomes a better drying oil than it was previous to the action of heat.</p>

<p>Oil boiled with 10 per cent, of litharge for three hours, is a much
better dryer than when heated without this oxide.</p>

<p>Oil boiled alone for five hours is an inferior drying oil to one heated
for only three hours.</p>

<p>Oil previously boiled alone for five hours, and boiled alone again for
three hours, is scarcely altered in drying power, but it becomes a
better drying oil if it is boiled the second time with litharge. It is
inferior to a drying oil which has been boiled only three hours with
litharge, without being submitted to a previous boiling.</p>

<p>Oil boiled alone for five hours, boiled for a further period of three
hours with manganese dioxide which has already been used for one
operation, is very nearly as strong a dryer as that which has been
boiled with litharge under the same conditions; but it is superior to an
oil which has been boiled with manganese dioxide for eight hours. This
no doubt arises from the longer boiling with manganese having caused a
larger quantity of manganese to dissolve, and that the quantity
dissolved is in excess of that which yields the best result.</p>

<p>Finally, oil boiled for five hours, and then boiled alone once more for
eight hours, becomes viscous, and the first coat requires a considerable
time to dry. We thus see that the oxides of lead and of manganese in
certain proportions concur with heat in increasing the drying power of
linseed oil. This drying of oils is a process of slow oxidation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>The following points of Chevreul’s appeared to be difficult of
satisfactory explanation, and suggested to Prof. Hartley an examination
<i>de novo</i> of the facts, as well as an investigation of the chemistry of
the subject generally:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Linseed oil not boiled acted as a dryer to the same oil boiled with
manganese dioxide.</p>

<p>2. Linseed oil, boiled with either litharge or manganese dried more
rapidly when mixed with turpentine.</p>

<p>3. Oil, mixed with white lead, zinc white, antimony white, and arseniate
of tin, acts differently, thus:&mdash;The white lead dries most rapidly, the
zinc white next, but antimony white and arseniate of tin are incapable
of acting as dryers, in fact, they retard the drying process.</p>

<p>4. Oil boiled alone for five hours, and boiled for a further period of
three hours with manganese dioxide becomes a superior drying oil to one
which has been boiled with manganese dioxide for eight hours.</p>

<p>From a series of experiments, which were continued for two years, on
twenty-five weighed quantities of raw linseed oil, Prof. Hartley draws
the following deductions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The chemical action of a manganese compound, when dissolved in
linseed oil, is that of a carrier of oxygen from the atmosphere to the
oil. Manganese oxide takes up oxygen from the air, and transfers it to
the oil, and in so doing it suffers alternately the opposite processes
of oxidation and reduction.</p>

<p>2. To obtain the best result, the amount of manganese present must not
exceed a certain small proportion of the oil.</p>

<p>3. Oil to which turpentine has been added dries more rapidly than oil
without such addition, because the oil being diluted and rendered
thinner, it spreads over a larger surface, and is in contact, therefore,
with a much larger quantity of oxygen.</p>

<p>4. Turpentine does not act as a dryer, that is, as a carrier of oxygen
to linseed oil.</p>

<p>5. Different white pigments behave differently when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span> drying, because the
more powerfully basic the properties of the pigment, the more powerful
is its action as a dryer. Lead oxide and white lead (basic lead
carbonate) combine more easily with the acids of linseed oil than zinc
oxide does. But zinc oxide dries better than antimony oxide, because it
is a stronger base, while arseniate of tin has no basic properties,
therefore does not act as a dryer.</p>

<p>Different substances, that is to say, those without chemical action on
oil, such as lamp-black, sulphate of baryta, and sulphate of lead,
cannot act as “dryers.”</p>

<p>Linseed oil is a glyceride of a peculiar acid, called linoleic acid.
Whatever the exact constitution of linoleic acid may be, linseed oil for
the most part is composed of trilinolein. Raw linseed oil contains the
following constituents:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Glyceride of linoleic acid or trilinolein</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td rowspan="2" valign="middle"><big><big><big>{</big></big></big></td><td align="left">C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>31</sub>O</td><td rowspan="2" valign="middle"><big><big><big>}</big></big></big>O<sub>3</sub>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp;C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>&nbsp; &nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>2. Water.</p>

<p>3. Mucilage, with the composition <i>n</i>(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>). On boiling with
dilute acids this yields a gum and a sugar.</p>

<p>4. An essential oil, present in minute proportions, and of unknown
composition.</p>

<p>5. A mixture of colouring matters of intense tinctorial power, viz. blue
and yellow chlorophylls and erythrophyll.</p>

<p>The only useful and desirable substance is the trilinolein.</p>

<p>The effect of oxidation upon linseed oil is to destroy all the
glycerine, and to produce therefrom carbonic, formic, and acetic acids,
together with some acrolein. When boiled at a high temperature without
the addition of any metallic oxide, the glyceride is decomposed,
acrolein is formed, and linoleic acid is set free. In fact, whether oil
is oxidised by air or by metallic oxides, or whether it be simply
heated, the action in each case first leads to the destruction of the
glycerine and the liberation of linoleic acid. But linoleic acid very
readily absorbs oxygen, and the oxidised substance becomes a tough
elastic solid, which is essentially a varnish.</p>

<p>In fact, the process which an oil undergoes in drying is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span> not
desiccation, or depriving it of moisture or of glycerine, but
solidification, and the technical term “drying” is a misnomer. That,
however, is of little consequence if we really know what is the chemical
action of the “drying” process. When oxidised even at a low temperature,
the glycerine is destroyed, and the oxidised products form a tough
varnish.</p>

<p>There are various methods of converting linseed oil into a drying oil or
varnish:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Heating it to a high temperature with litharge.</p>

<p>2. Heating with red oxide of lead.</p>

<p>3. Heating with metallic lead.</p>

<p>4. Heating to a high temperature with manganic oxide.</p>

<p>5. Heating with manganese borate.</p>

<p>6. Heating with manganese oxalate.</p>

<p>7. By the joint action of air and heat upon the oil and manganous oxide,
or a solution of manganese dioxide or manganous oxide in the oil.</p>

<p>In the processes 1, 2, 3, there can be no doubt that a lead of linoleic
acid is produced, and that this facilitates further oxidation in air, by
forming salts with some of the acid products of such oxidation, while
the oxidation of the linoleic acid continues. Heating with red lead
favours oxidation, by the compound itself conveying oxygen to the oil.
In the case of metallic lead, it must be noted that the metal is
dissolved. Under certain circumstances, metals become dryers to oils;
thus sheets of metallic lead are capable of acting as dryers to linseed
oil.</p>

<p>Linseed oil is pre-eminent in its capacity for absorbing oxygen. This
action of metallic lead as a dryer is due to the metal becoming oxidised
at the expense of the glycerine of the oil, and so passing into solution
by combining with the linoleic acid, or with acetic or formic acid,
caused by the oxidation of the glycerine. It is the destruction of the
glycerine with concurrent oxidation of the fatty acid which causes the
drying or hardening of the oil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>When a drying oil which has been treated with metallic lead, or with
litharge, is shaken up with a solution of zinc sulphate, all the lead is
precipitated from the oil, and zinc passes into solution therein. By
manganese sulphate or copper sulphate, the lead is removed by manganese
or copper. Oil charged with lead dries in 24 hours when spread out in a
thin layer on glass; it will dry completely in 5 or 6 hours if charged
with manganese, in 30 or 36 hours with copper, zinc, or cobalt; and it
requires more than 48 hours with nickel, iron, chromium, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Although solidification of a drying oil charged with manganese takes
place in from 5 to 6 hours when spread in thin films, the solidification
of thicker films requires a longer time. A temperature of 122° to 140°
F. accelerates the oxidation of the drying oils, partly because the oil
becomes more fluid, and partly because the oxygen is more active at a
higher temperature. Hence, oil which has been mixed with an equal volume
of turpentine, or a light hydrocarbon, such as benzene, dries more
rapidly than oil without such admixture.</p>

<p>When a boiled oil, prepared with manganese, is dissolved in an equal
volume of benzene, and shaken up with air in a bottle, rapid absorption
of oxygen occurs, especially about 120° F. If fresh air is repeatedly
provided, the oxidation is sufficient to cause the liquid to become
thick, and, on distilling off the sapient, a perfectly dry and elastic
solid remains.</p>

<p>An oil containing manganese is a very superior drying oil to one which
has been prepared with lead. This fact, however, is to be noted, that
though a large proportion of manganese in an oil may hasten its drying,
yet it is disadvantageous, because it does not form so tough a film.
This arises from the film becoming hard upon the surface, and so
protecting the oil underneath from absorbing oxygen from the air.</p>

<p>Though the oils containing large quantities of dryers dry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span> they
afterwards lose weight, and become viscous under the same conditions.</p>

<p>Pure linoleates of lead and of zinc are not dryers; but if heated until
it has turned brown, or begun to blacken, a lead dryer becomes
effective, although it contains less of the lead compound.</p>

<p>In this case, some compound of lead is formed by absorption of oxygen,
which either itself actually oxidises or causes the oxidation of
ordinary linseed oil.</p>

<p>Having treated of the materials used for producing boiled oil, and of
their action upon the oil, let us now consider how the operation is
brought about.</p>

<p><i>Process 1.</i>&mdash;Oil is boiled at a high temperature, that is to say, it is
heated until frothing and bubbles of gas escape, when litharge or a
manganese compound is added.</p>

<p><i>Process 2.</i>&mdash;Oil is boiled at a steam heat, with litharge or a
manganese compound, in conjunction with a blast of air.</p>

<p><i>Process 1.</i>&mdash;The chemical action in the first process is doubtless one
which takes place in three stages. It commences by depriving the oil of
water; in the second stage, it destroys the mucilage, by charring it; in
the third, it destroys, in part, the glycerine, and sets free the fatty
acids. After the litharge or manganese compound is added, there is
formed in the oil a solution of lead salts of the fatty acids, or a
manganese salt of the fatty acids.</p>

<p>The oil then, at the high temperature, loses glycerine by oxidation
caused by the air, such oxidation being greatly facilitated by the
presence of manganese compounds, which are repeatedly oxidised by the
air and reduced by the oil, that is to say, they absorb oxygen and pass
it over to the oil with great facility.</p>

<p>It matters little, so long as the ultimate action is oxidation, what
salt of manganese or what oxide is used, if it be capable of undergoing
processes of an alternate character called oxidations and reductions.</p>

<p>It is, however, certain that some manganese compounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span> are more suitable
than others, owing to their more or less complete solubility in the oil,
and their more readily undergoing the two different processes of
oxidation and reduction in presence of air and of oil.</p>

<p><i>Process 2.</i>&mdash;The credit of being the first to boil oil without
resorting to the dangerous expedient of using an open fire and a high,
temperature in the manufacture, is due to Vincent. He used manganese
compounds, or both manganese salts and litharge. His method of boiling
oil for the manufacture of printing inks is, with some modifications in
technical details, carried out on a large scale at the present time in
the preparation of ordinary boiled oil. The essential parts of the plant
are a steam-jacketed close boiler with agitating gear, and a pipe for
conducting a current of air into the oil by means of a blowing engine.
From the head of the boiler there passes a funnel under the back of the
furnace fire, by which the disagreeable products of the chemical action
are conducted to a place where they are destroyed. These products, as
already mentioned, are volatile fatty acids and acrolein.</p>

<p>Oil boiling, as ordinarily carried out, is conducted by means of
litharge along with compounds of manganese; in some processes these are
mixed with salts of alumina and zinc. The oil so produced is brown and
not clear, but it is clarified by keeping. Many samples of such boiled
oil deposit insoluble matter when stored for some time, even although
they may have become clear previously. This is not a desirable property.
Sometimes rosin is added to hasten its drying.</p>

<p>The defects to be noticed, even in the best samples of boiled oil, are
the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The oil causes a brownish or yellow colour to be communicated to
white lead or zinc white.</p>

<p>2. The oil darkens pigments containing brilliantly coloured metallic
sulphides, such as vermilion, cadmium yellow, and ultramarine blue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Delicate colours are darkened by the oil when exposed to ordinary
town air, that is to say, air which, is not quite pure. This is the case
even when the oils themselves may not injure the paints.</p>

<p>The causes of such alterations is, in nine cases out of ten, the use of
lead dryers.</p>

<p>1. In the first place, boiled oil which contains litharge or other lead
compounds takes a permanent brown colour, which affects the purity of
white lead, zinc white, and delicate pale tints.</p>

<p>2. Lead forms, with extreme ease, lead sulphide, which, in very minute
proportions, is yellow or brown; in larger quantity its colour is black.
The lead sulphide is readily formed by contact with other sulphides, as,
for instance, vermilion, cadmium yellow, and ultramarine.</p>

<p>3. Boiled oil, containing lead, is coloured brown by exposure to air,
owing to the presence of minute quantities of sulphuretted hydrogen,
which causes the formation of lead sulphide.</p>

<p>The remedy is obvious: no oil should be used which has been boiled with
dryers containing lead. In other words, oil should be boiled with pure
manganese compounds only.</p>

<p>In cases where it is desirable to have information of the presence or
absence of lead in a boiled oil, the following test will be found most
useful:&mdash;A mixture is made of 4 oz. of glycerine with 1 oz. of ammonium
sulphide, the liquid being kept in a stoppered bottle. Or glycerine is
mixed with an equal volume of water, and saturated with sulphuretted
hydrogen. Half an ounce of the oil to be tested is placed in a white
basin, with the addition of two or three drops of the glycerine
solution. The two liquids are thoroughly incorporated, by stirring with
a strip of glass. A brown or black colour, which gradually appears,
indicates the presence of lead. A pure manganese oil simply becomes
slightly yellow. It is true that, if iron is present, a black colour
might appear, but iron is also an undesirable impurity. Should it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
required to ascertain that the coloration is or is not caused by iron,
two or three drops of glacial acetic acid may be stirred into the oil,
when, if the black colour remains, it is certainly not caused by iron.</p>

<p>Under the old process of oil-boiling at a high temperature, the brown
colour of the oil was, to some extent, an indication that the oil had
been sufficiently heated&mdash;that is to say, properly boiled; but in the
modern processes, so largely used, in which oxidation is aided by a
blast of air, this coloration is no indication whatever of the
excellence of the oil; it may be, in fact, the very reverse.</p>

<p>This fact appears to be unknown, or, at any rate, is not a matter of
common knowledge among practical men in this country, who, being
uninformed as to the methods of preparing the oils, consider that a
brown colour is desirable, if not essential.</p>

<p>When oil-boilers were compelled to adopt some expedient to give a
reddish-brown colour to the oil, they added a small amount of litharge,
the introduction of which actually spoils the oil, and makes it
unsuitable for many purposes to which it is otherwise applicable. Of
late years, pale boiled oils have been more largely manufactured for
special purposes. It is obvious that, for decorative house painting, in
which delicate tints are a leading feature, they may be advantageously
employed.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that some of the brown oils, when mixed with white lead,
do not entirely retain the brownish tint, but, to some extent, lose it
upon drying, yet they never preserve the whiteness of white lead. It
follows, therefore, that a pale colour in the oil, provided it is not
the yellow colour of raw oil, is greatly to be preferred. Moreover, when
paints are mixed with zinc white, no trace of lead should be contained
in the oil, otherwise, one of the valuable properties of zinc white
pigments is destroyed, namely, its power to retain its whiteness in the
atmosphere of a town, because its colour is not affected by sulphuretted
hydrogen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Very generally, zinc white and white lead paints are not mixed with
drying oils, but with refined linseed or bleached oil. This, at any
rate, is the practice on the Continent. That is to say, the pigments are
mixed with an oil from which the impurities, and the natural yellow and
red colouring matter, have been removed, so that the colour of the paint
is white. If ordinary oil be used, the paint is more or less yellow. In
order to render such paint quick drying, a certain amount of dryers, in
a solid or liquid form, is added. These dryers almost invariably contain
lead, so that zinc white paint is contaminated by lead in another way,
which may not be suspected, or which is overlooked.</p>

<p>Now as to the chemical action of dryers on oils. Raw oil contains water
and mucilage; the former can be absorbed by anhydrous zinc salts and by
dried alum, and solutions of the salts and the salts themselves are
capable of precipitating mucilage from the oil; hence these substances
cause the impurities to become insoluble, so that they are carried down
as “foots.” Heat greatly facilitates this action, particularly by
causing the oil to become more fluid; and by the action of the anhydrous
salts water is withdrawn from the oil. On the “drying” or oxidation of
the oil, they exert no chemical action whatever.</p>

<p>Zinc linoleate and lead linoleate do not act as dryers when simply added
to the oil. Though the former is soluble in hot oil it is insoluble in
cold oil, and it therefore separates from the oil as it cools. The
latter is very soluble in linseed oil, but only adds to its drying power
when heated therewith.</p>

<p>In conjunction with a high temperature, lead dissolves in oil at the
expense of the glycerine, which is decomposed into acrolein, while lead
linoleate is formed.</p>

<p>When litharge is heated with linseed oil, the action is somewhat
similar, the substances formed being acrolein, lead linoleate, and
linoleic acid.</p>

<p>If we consider the action of red lead on trilinolein, we have not only
the formation of these lead linoleates, but an excess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span> of oxygen
available for the oxidation of glycerine to acrolein and acrylic acid,
or to acetic and formic acids.</p>

<p>These equations serve to show the effect of lead and lead oxides in what
may be termed the initiation of the chemical action upon the oil.
Subsequent changes, no doubt, depend upon the conditions which obtain at
the time, notably upon the temperature and upon access of air to the
oil. It is probable that acid linoleates are formed, and that compounds
formed from the polymerisation of linoleic acid result eventually.</p>

<p>Whatever doubt there may be as to the action of lead salts, there can be
none whatever as to that of manganese compounds. In the first place,
manganous oxide is a powerful base, which readily dissolves in oil;
manganic oxide is also readily soluble, yielding fatty acid salts of
manganese, and causing oxidation of glycerine. Manganese borate and
manganese oxalate are both soluble in oil, the former much more readily
than the latter, but they are both salts of little stability at high
temperatures in contact with oils. They both dissolve by the aid of
heat, forming fatty acid salts of manganese. Borate liberates boric acid
under these circumstances, but oxalate yields a mixture of carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>Of manganese oleate and linoleate nothing more may be said than that
both are extremely soluble in oil, and both easily oxidised from
colourless to brown compounds when submitted to the action of air.</p>

<p>The chief adulterants of linseed oil and of boiled oil are cotton-seed
oil, rosin oil, and linoleic acid. Cotton-seed, which is to some extent
a drying oil, can act as such when mixed with linseed, but when added to
olive oil, it behaves as a non-drying oil. In fact, its behaviour is
anomalous, and of such a character that it greatly facilitates its
extensive use as an adulterating material for the more expensive oils.</p>

<p>Rosin oil is a deleterious adulterant, but one which may be more readily
detected than cotton-seed oil. Rosin is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span> added to boiled oil to hasten
its drying; this also is an injurious substance. Of late years glycerine
has become an article of greater value than formerly, and this may
account for the manufacture of linoleic acid and its use as an
adulterant of oleic acid and of linseed oil.</p>

<p>Lastly, it may be mentioned that certain samples of “pale boiled oil”
have been found to contain what is practically a raw oil mixed with
dryers. Although such oils will dry, their efficiency is nothing like so
great as that of an oil “boiled” with a blast of air at a suitable
temperature, and, moreover, such oils are deficient in body.</p>

<p>In bleaching vegetable oils, it is necessary to consider the nature of
the colouring matters naturally contained in them. These consist of a
mixture in varying proportions of the colouring matters known to exist
in the leaves of plants, but which, in the case of oils, are derived
from the fruit or seeds from which the oils are expressed. There can be
no doubt that these substances are closely allied in chemical
constitution; they all possess an intensely powerful colouring property,
by which is meant that though the colour of some of them may not be
dark, yet a very minute weight is capable of imparting a tint to a very
large quantity of material.</p>

<p>The names of these substances are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquott">
<p class="nind">Xanthophyll&mdash;yellow.<br />
Yellow chlorophyll&mdash;yellow.<br />
Blue chlorophyll&mdash;blue.<br />
Erythrophyll&mdash;red.</p>
</div>

<p>In some oils only the xanthophyll and yellow chlorophyll are present; in
others, such as olive oil, the yellow and blue chlorophylls occur, and
give the liquid a green tint; while in linseed erythrophyll is always
present with more or less of the yellow and blue chlorophylls, and some
xanthophyll. According to the different proportions of these colouring
matters the oil varies in colour. For instance, linseed oil, when brown,
contains a mixture of erythrophyll with yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span> and blue chlorophylls;
when greenish brown, the yellow and blue chlorophylls are present in
somewhat larger proportion, but mixed with erythrophyll; while,
generally speaking, a bright yellow or pale yellow oil contains
xanthophyll only. These substances appear to be combined with the oils,
or to be substances of a fatty nature. They are neither dissolved nor
acted upon by water, nor by acids diluted with water, when naturally
contained in the oils. They are freely soluble in alcohol, and an
alcoholic solution is not only susceptible of being destroyed by the
joint action of air and water, but by very dilute aqueous solutions of
mineral acids, and by acetic acid. In aqueous and alcoholic solutions,
light speedily modifies the blue, and eventually destroys all these
colours. A solution in turpentine of the isolated colouring matters is
also easily destroyed. But, on the other hand, a solution of the colours
in melted paraffin wax is comparatively stable.</p>

<p>Zinc hydroxide, copper hydroxide, baryta, potash, and soda easily
combine to form metallic salts with blue chlorophyll, less readily,
though readily enough with yellow chlorophyll, but far less readily with
xanthophyll and erythrophyll. The following facts will serve to show
that this is the case. When a solution of the colouring matters
contained in green leaves is made by extracting dry, but
freshly-gathered, leaves with absolute alcohol, an addition of a
saturated solution of baryta water, to the intensely green extract,
precipitates first the compound of blue chlorophyll with baryta, then a
further addition precipitates the yellow chlorophyll, also as a baryta
salt; but xanthophyll and erythrophyll either remain in solution, or
require a much larger addition of the base in order to be precipitated.
A crystalline compound of blue chlorophyll with soda is comparatively
stable. This substance is, no doubt, formed in green vegetables when
they are boiled in water to which some carbonate of soda has been added
to maintain their fresh appearance. The addition of a small trace of
copper sulphate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span> to peas and to pickles forms a very permanent copper
compound with the colouring matter, which gives an attractive appearance
to these articles. Such being an outline of the chief chemical
properties of the natural colouring matters contained in oils, the facts
mentioned will serve to render the processes for removing the colour
from oils more intelligible than they otherwise would be.</p>

<p>Vegetable oils are decolorised, either partially or completely, by the
application of one of the following processes:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. By the action of light, or by the joint action of light and air.</p>

<p>2. By acids.</p>

<p>3. By saponification.</p>

<p>4. By the action of chlorine.</p>

<p>1. By exposing raw linseed oil to the action of sunlight, it slowly
becomes pale in colour, and finally colourless. It is in the highest
degree probable that, as oxygen is absorbed by the oil and acid
substances are thereby produced, these acids effect the destruction of
the colouring matters. In such wise castor oil is bleached.</p>

<p>2. By treating linseed oil with moderately strong sulphuric acid. As the
oil and sulphuric acid are of very different specific gravities, it is
essential that they be very rapidly and thoroughly mixed by violent
agitation. The impurities, such as mucilage and albuminous matters, are
thus deprived of water, and more or less charred, and along with them
the colouring matters are destroyed by the acid. It is essential for the
success of the process that the oil and the acid be not long in contact
without undergoing dilution, otherwise the oil itself may become
charred. It is, however, possible to obtain oil by this process in a
fairly colourless condition, after it has been thoroughly washed with
water and allowed to settle.</p>

<p>3. Both rape oil and cotton oil may be rendered of a pale yellow, and
even almost colourless, by a process of partial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span> saponification with
caustic alkali of a suitable strength. The colouring matters are
saponified, and the resulting soap is of a dark yellow or brown colour,
from the colouring matter having combined with the alkali.</p>

<p>4. By the action of chlorine produced in contact with the oil when, for
instance, an aqueous solution of bleaching powder is acidified with a
cheap mineral acid, such as dilute sulphuric. In this case rapid mixing
and violent agitation are essential to the success of the process,
otherwise chlorinised products are retained in the oil, which not only
confer upon it a distinct flavour and odour, but also cause the oil to
solidify with a very moderate lowering of the normal temperature. It is
very questionable whether drying oils can with advantage be submitted to
such treatment.</p>

<p>5. A variety of methods may be merely mentioned, such as treatment with
sulphurous acid, with ferrous sulphate (green vitriol), and potassium
dichromate and sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>6. Lastly, the method of Binks, to which reference will be made farther
on.</p>

<p>Prof. Hartley next gives an account of certain improvements in the
process of oil-boiling, designed with the object of producing a drying
oil absolutely free from lead, and, as compared with ordinary oils,
absolutely free from colour.</p>

<p>The operations have been carried out, on a manufacturing scale, by Mr.
W. E. B. Blenkinsop and himself, and there is no doubt of the
practicability of the process.</p>

<p>The process consists in, first, refining the oil, by the removal
therefrom of water and mucilage; second, boiling and bleaching the oil
at one operation.</p>

<p>It is a fact that water and mucilage can be removed from linseed oil by
the action of certain dehydrating substances and solutions of metallic
salts, as, for instance, by alum, by strong sulphuric acid, and by a
solution of zinc chloride.</p>

<p>There are certain objections to each of these methods, which are of a
practical nature: thus, in treating the oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span> with strong sulphuric acid,
there is too frequently a charring of something, either the oil itself,
or of some impurity therein, and this charring, though it may be very
slight, has the effect of giving a pale brownish tinge to the oil, which
cannot be completely removed by the bleaching process to which the
natural colouring matters in the oil are amenable. It is quite true that
this brown colour separates sometimes, but it is only after storage for
a long period, when a finely divided flocculent matter separates by
subsidence. Treatment with zinc chloride is satisfactory but expensive.
Perfectly pure manganese sulphate, which is a neutral salt, has been
used by Hartley and Blenkinsop in very strong solution, and where there
is an objection to using an acid. For ordinary purposes, perfectly
satisfactory results are obtained by the use of a dilute sulphuric acid
containing about 30 per cent. of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, since, though it possesses
the power of withdrawing water from the oil, it may remain in contact
therewith without causing any charring, and at the same time it causes
the precipitation in a complete and rapid manner of all the mucilage. A
purified linseed oil is thus produced which is bright, clear, and
slightly yellowish in colour, though somewhat paler than the ordinary
oil. It is important that the strength of the oil should not exceed that
degree of concentration which is sufficient for the purpose for which it
is intended. The oil having been so treated, and the impurities
separated by subsidence or otherwise, it is next submitted to the
bleaching and oxidising treatment.</p>

<p>Binks bleached oils with oxides of manganese dissolved in the oil, but
difficulty was experienced in carefully regulating the quantity of the
manganese compounds which were to be introduced into the oil. For
instance, he precipitated manganous hydroxide in contact with oil, and
added the mixture to the bulk of the material, and he also modified the
treatment by dissolving manganous hydroxide in ammonia, and added the
solution to the oil.</p>

<p>Hartley and Blenkinsop prepare manganese linoleate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span> dissolve this
in a hydrocarbon, and add a sufficient quantity of the solution to the
oil, whereby it dissolves easily and mixes completely. By this
treatment, the colouring matter of the oil forms a compound with the
manganese which, while it remains in solution, is very speedily oxidised
in contact with air, especially when a current of air or oxygen is blown
through. The oxidation destroys the colouring matter, and the manganese
compound is deoxidised; subsequently it undergoes oxidation again, and
the products of such oxidation taking place in the oil are acrolein,
formic and acetic acids. After, or concurrently with, the oxidation of
the colouring matters, the oil is oxidised, and, at a suitable
temperature below 132° F., the oil is bleached, increased in density,
and converted into a pale drying oil. By limiting the amount of the
manganese linoleate to that which is capable of just oxidising the
colouring matters, oils may be bleached with very little further
oxidation.</p>

<p>Excellent drying oils have been produced by this process, of a very pale
colour. The oil has been used for decorative house painting, for both
indoor and outdoor work, on wood and on metal. It has also been used as
a coating for iron work, without the addition of a pigment. The plant
used in its production is the same as that employed in oil-boiling by
the usual processes when a blast of air is used.</p>

<p>The advantages of a pale boiled oil, containing no lead, are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Zinc white retains its pure white colour.</p>

<p>2. Delicate tints, and colours containing sulphides, are not darkened in
course of time.</p>

<p>It may be suggested that for indoor decoration, for the painting of
ships, railway carriages, railway semaphores, signs, and stations, such
oil is free from liability to alter the colours with which it is mixed,
owing to its freedom from lead, which is darkened by traces of
sulphuretted hydrogen in the air to which such paints are exposed.</p>

<p>Gasometers in gas-works may be painted an unalterable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span> white with such
oil and zinc white. But in this case also the zinc white must be free
from lead carbonate or oxide.</p>

<p>In commenting on Prof. Hartley’s paper, Mr. Laurie said he had never
used linoleate of manganese for boiling with oil, but by the use of
borate one did get a boiled oil paler than the oil with which one
started. If you take linseed oil which has been already bleached in the
sun to a golden yellow, and convert it into boiled oil with manganese, a
further bleaching process undoubtedly takes place. An oil prepared with
manganese salts, spread on a glass plate, and allowed to dry in the
dark, will remain almost colourless, whereas if it were boiled with a
lead salt it quickly darkens, even if it is kept away from impure air.
Even in a dark room, in pure air, a picture painted with oil boiled with
lead will darken. That is another argument in favour of manganese, and
he should say it ought always to be used in preparing oil for artistic
purposes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>The utility of having the pug mills placed above the granite rollers is
to save labour and space, and the roller mill is kept constantly at
work. There are two pugs, one of which is always ready to deliver to the
rollers, whilst the other is getting ready by the time the first is
being emptied; by this means the output is always going on, and hence
great saving both of time and labour. The pugs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>This firm are also the manufacturers of Clark’s patent paint mill,
illustrated in <a href="#fig_44">Fig. 44</a>. This mill differs from the ordinary mills in
having five instead of three rollers. The material is fed in between the
two uppermost rollers, being prevented from spreading too much by means
of wooden cheeks shaped so as to fit between the rollers and form a kind
of hopper in which the material to be ground is placed. From these two

<p class="nind">apart of the rollers and the fineness of the grinding can be adjusted.
It will be seen that the driving-shaft of the machine is the lowest of
the six shown. It drives by means of spur gearing roller number three,
and through it the other rollers of the mill. No two rollers working
together revolve at the same speed, and hence one rubs over the other,
and they thoroughly grind the material between them. In the common
three-roller mills it is necessary to pass the material to be ground
through the mill twice, but in this machine one passage is sufficient,
so that both time and floor space are saved, as the machine, it is
claimed, does the work of two ordinary mills. Another noteworthy feature
of this mill is that on No. 2 roller is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">lateral motion giving a sidewise movement of ¾ inch. This is also
applied to No. 4 roller, and gives the same movement. Each roller can be
separately and easily adjusted by means of adjusting screws. The fifth
roller is the delivery roller. The weight of No. 2 roller is carried by
a strong spring fixed between the bearings of rollers Nos. 2 and 3, so
that by the movement of the adjusting screw, the No. 2 roller can be
brought down upon No. 3 with the required pressure.</p>

<p>The principle of mounting the rollers of most machines, is that the
centre roll shall revolve in fixed bearings, and the two outer ones
shall revolve in bearings made to slide backward and forward in grooves
in the framework. There is no means of adjusting the rollers in order to
keep them in perfect parallel plane, or to compensate for the wear of
the brasses. The consequence is, that immediately the bearings begin to
wear, the rolls are not then in parallel plane with each other, and the
longer they work the worse they get; until they only grind a small
distance in the centre of the roll, causing the machine not only to
perform imperfect work, but the rolls to wear hollow in the centre.</p>

<p>Hind and Lund, Limited, of the Atlas Works, Preston, Lancashire, claim
that in their machine (<a href="#fig_45">Fig. 45</a>) these defects are entirely obviated. The
centre roll is mounted in a similar manner to other machines, but the
two outer rolls are hung upon excentric studs at each side. Should the
journals wear at all unevenly, this is at once detached, and by a single
turn of the excentric stud at either one side or the other as the case
may be, the rolls are kept always in perfect parallel plane.</p>

<p>This machine is fitted with relieving apparatus for throwing the two
outer rolls apart whilst working, in case of accident, or for cleaning
purposes. Thus the machine may be run for an indefinite period without
the granite touching, hence no wear can take place; while the rollers
may be instantly put back to their working distances, just exactly as
they were before the rolls were thrown apart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>As will be readily understood, this is a very valuable improvement, as
the machine can be put in and out of actual grinding work as often as
may be desired, without once altering the pressure upon the springs or
the grinding distances.</p>

<p>The bearings are all self-lubricating, and the most delicate colours or
white lead can be ground without fear of being deteriorated. The machine
too is almost noiseless. Many of them can be seen at work, and giving
great satisfaction.</p>

<p class="nind">stirrers, similar to those in a pug-mill, which are driven by means of
the pulley <i>l</i>, <i>m</i> being a loose pulley; by shifting the strap on to
this, the machine can be stopped at once. When the oil has been
thoroughly incorporated with the pigment, the mixture is allowed to run
through the spout <i>g</i> on the roller <i>a</i>. Working against <i>a</i> is a second
roller <i>b</i>, and this in its turn bears upon a third roller <i>c</i>. In order
to prevent the grooving of the faces of the rollers, which always takes
place when they revolve in the same plane, there is an arrangement by
which a slight lateral motion is communicated to <i>b</i>, in addition to the
rotary motion. A pin fixed upon the rigid bracket <i>k</i> works in the
grooved cam <i>i</i>, which is keyed on the shaft of the roller <i>b</i>. The
grinding power of the machine is considerably increased by this
modification. The rollers are worked from the pulley <i>d</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span> the loose
pulley <i>e</i> receives the strap when a pause in the working of the machine
becomes necessary. The details of the construction of the grinding
machine are given in <a href="#fig_48">Fig. 48</a>. The rollers <i>a b c</i> are constructed of
granite or porcelain; for fine grinding, the latter substance is
preferable. They are adjusted by means of the screws <i>g h</i>. These are
furnished with spiral springs, so that should a nail or other hard
substance get between the rollers, these can rise in their bearings,
letting the nail fall down at the back. The “doctor” or scraper <i>f</i>
removes the paint from the surface of the roller <i>c</i>; <i>a b</i> are also
provided with smaller scrapers, which remove any paint that may cake
upon their surfaces. Where extreme fineness is requisite, the paint is
again passed through the machine, and this operation is sometimes
repeated several times.</p>

<p>In working these or any other form of grinding rollers, great care must
be taken to clean them thoroughly immediately after use. If the paint be
allowed to dry upon the surface of the rollers it is difficult of
removal, and interferes with the perfect action of the machine. Should
the working parts become clogged with solidified oil, a strong solution
of caustic soda or potash will remove it. By means of the same
solutions, porcelain rollers may be kept quite white, even if used for
mixing coloured paints. Although the colour of most pigments is improved
by grinding them finely in oil, yet there are some which suffer in
intensity where their size of grain is reduced. Chrome red, for
instance, owes its deep colour to the crystals of which it is composed,
and when these are reduced to extremely fine fragments, the colour is
considerably modified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Packing.</span>&mdash;When paint is not intended for immediate use, it is packed in
metallic kegs. The construction of these, as made by B. Noakes &amp; Co., is
shown in <a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49</a>. For exportation to hot climates, the rim of the lid is
sometimes soldered down, a practice which effectually prevents access of
atmospheric oxygen. White-lead paint is frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span> packed in wooden
kegs; these prevent the discoloration sometimes caused by the metal of
iron kegs. When paint is mixed ready for use, it will, if exposed to the
air, become covered with a skin, which soon attains sufficient thickness
to exclude the atmospheric oxygen, and prevent any further
solidification of the oil. The paint may be still better protected by
pouring water over it, or it may be placed in air-tight cans. If it has
been allowed to stand for some time, it must be well stirred before
using, as the pigments have a tendency not only to separate from the
oil, but also to settle down according to their specific gravity.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br /><br />
<b>PAINTING.</b></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> successful application of paint, whether for artistic or
preservative purposes, necessitates careful attention to a number of
considerations, some of a mechanical and others of a chemical character.</p>

<p><i>The Surface.</i>&mdash;Of whatever the surface may be to which the paint is to
be applied, great care must be taken that it is perfectly dry. Wood
especially, even when apparently dry, may on a damp day contain as much
as 20 per cent. of moisture. A film of paint applied to the surface of
wood in this condition prevents the moisture from escaping, and it
remains enclosed until a warm sun or artificial heat converts it into
vapour, which raises the paint and causes blisters. Moisture enclosed
between two coats of paint has the same effect. Paint rarely blisters
when applied to wood from which old paint has been burnt off; this is
probably due to the drying of the wood during the operation of burning.</p>

<p>When the surface to be painted is already covered with old paint, this
should be either removed or rubbed down smooth before applying the new.
When the thickness of the old coat is not great, rubbing down,
accompanied by a careful scraping of blisters and defective parts, will
suffice. When the thickness of the old paint necessitates its removal,
it may either be burned off, or softened by a solution of caustic
alkali, and afterwards scraped. The burning process is the most
effective, and leaves the wood in a fit condition to receive the fresh
coat of paint; but it is not applicable in the case of fine mouldings.
When caustic potash or soda is used, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span> paint is left in contact with,
it for some time, when the linoleic acid of the oxidised linseed-oil
becomes saponified, and can easily be scraped or scrubbed off the
surface of the wood.</p>

<p>Whenever an alkali is employed, it is of the greatest importance that
the wood should afterwards be thoroughly washed several times with clean
water, in order to remove every trace of the solvents. Any soda or
potash remaining in the pores of the wood would not only retain moisture
and cause blistering, but would also have an injurious action upon the
vehicle of the paint subsequently applied, and in many cases upon the
pigment itself. The remarks already made as to the necessity of an
absolutely dry surface should be borne in mind in this instance. When
the surface of the paint is to be protected by a coat of varnish, the
latter should not be applied until the whole of the oil contained in the
paint has solidified. The wrinkling of varnish upon paint is frequently
erroneously attributed to the bad quality of the varnish, when the real
cause is the incomplete oxidation of the paint itself.</p>

<p><i>Priming.</i>&mdash;The first coat of paint applied to any surface is termed the
“priming-coat.” It usually consists of red lead and boiled and raw
linseed-oil. Experience has shown that such a priming not only dries
quickly itself, but also accelerates the drying of the next coat. The
latter action must be attributed to the oxygen contained in the red
lead, only a small portion of which is absorbed by the oil with which it
is mixed.</p>

<p>Kali, of Heidelberg, prepares a substitute for boiled oil by mixing 10
parts whipped blood, just as it is furnished from the slaughter-houses,
with 1 part of air-slaked lime sifted into it through a fine sieve. The
two are well mixed and left standing for 24 hours. The dirty portion
that collects on top is taken off, and the solid portion is broken loose
from the lime at the bottom; the latter is stirred up with water, left
to settle, and the water is poured off after the lime has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span> settled. The
clear liquid is well mixed up with the solid substance before mentioned.
This mass is left standing for 10 or 12 days, after which a solution of
potash permanganate is added, which decolorises it and prevents
putrefaction. Finally the mixture is stirred up, diluted with more water
to give it the consistence of very thin size, filtered, a few drops of
oil of lavender are added, and the preparation is preserved in closed
vessels. It is said to keep a long time without change. A single coat of
this liquid will suffice to prepare wood or paper, as well as lime or
hard plaster walls, for painting with oil colours. This substance is
cheaper than linseed oil, and closes the pores of the surface so
perfectly that it takes much less paint to cover it than when primed
with oil.</p>

<p><i>Drying.</i>&mdash;The drying of paint is to a great extent dependent upon the
temperature. Below the freezing point of water, paint will remain wet
for weeks, even when mixed with a considerable proportion of dryers;
while, if exposed to a heat of 120° F. the same paint will become solid
in a few hours. The drying of paint being a process of oxidation, and
not evaporation, it is essential that a good supply of fresh air should
be provided. When a film of fresh paint is placed with air in a closed
vessel, it does not absorb the whole of the oxygen present; but after a
time the drying process is arrested, and the remaining oxygen appears to
have become inert.</p>

<p>Considerable quantities of volatile vapours are given off during the
drying of paint; these are due to the decomposition of the oil. When the
paint has been thinned down by turpentine, the whole of this liquid
evaporates on exposure to the air. There must, therefore, be a plentiful
access of air, to remove the vapours formed, and afford a fresh supply
of active oxygen. The presence of moisture in the air is rather
beneficial than injurious at this stage. Especially in the case of
paints mixed with varnish, moist air appears to counteract the tendency
to crack or shrink. Under the erroneous im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>pression that the drying of
paint is a species of evaporation, open fires are sometimes kept up in
freshly-painted rooms. It is only when the temperature is very low that
any benefit can result from this practice; as a rule, it rather retards
than hastens the solidification of the oil, which cannot take place
rapidly in an atmosphere laden with carbonic acid.</p>

<p>The first coat of paint should be thoroughly dry before the second is
applied. Acrylic acid is formed during the oxidation of linseed-oil, and
unless this be allowed to evaporate, it may subsequently liberate
carbonic acid from the white lead present in most paints, and give rise
to blisters. Sometimes a second priming-coat is given; but usually the
second coat applied contains the pigment. This, as soon as dry, is again
covered by another coat, and subsequently by two or more finishing
coats, according to the nature of the work.</p>

<p><i>Filling.</i>&mdash;Before the first coat is applied to wood, all holes should
be filled up. The filling usually employed is ordinary putty; this,
however, sometimes consists of whiting ground up with oil foots of a
non-drying character, and when the films of paint are dry, the oil from
the putty exudes to the surface, causing a stain. The best filling for
ordinary purposes is whiting ground to a paste with boiled linseed-oil.
For finer work, and for filling cracks, red lead mixed with the same
vehicle may be employed. For porous hard woods, use boiled oil and corn
starch stirred into a very thick paste; add a little japan, and reduce
with turpentine. Add no colour for light ash; for dark ash and chestnut,
use a little raw sienna; for walnut, burnt umber and a slight amount of
Venetian red; for bay wood, burnt sienna. In no case use more colour
than is required to overcome the white appearance of the starch, unless
you wish to stain the wood. This filler is worked with brush and rags in
the usual manner. Let it dry 48 hours, or until it is in condition to
rub down with No. 0 sand-paper without much gumming up; and if an extra
fine finish is desired, fill again with the same materials, using less
oil, but more japan and turpentine. The second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span> coat will not shrink,
being supported by the first. When the second coat is hard, the wood is
ready for finishing up by following the usual methods. This formula is
not intended for rosewood.</p>

<p><i>Coats.</i>&mdash;There is no advantage in laying on the paint too thickly. A
thick film takes longer to dry thoroughly than two thin films of the
same aggregate thickness. Paint is thinned down or diluted with
linseed-oil or turpentine. The latter liquid, when used in excess,
causes the paint to dry with a dull surface, and has an injurious effect
upon its stability. Sometimes the last coat of paint is mixed with
varnish, in order to give it greater brilliancy. In this case, special
care must be taken that the previous coats have thoroughly solidified,
or cracks in the final coat may subsequently appear. The same remark
applies when the surface of the paint is varnished. The turpentine with
which the varnish is mixed has a powerful action upon the oil contained
in the paint, if the latter is not thoroughly oxidised. The exterior of
the paint is thus softened, and the varnish is enabled to shrink and
crack, especially in warm weather.</p>

<p><i>Brushes.</i>&mdash;The bristles are frequently fastened by glue or size, which
is not perceptibly acted upon by oil, and if brought into contact with
this liquid alone, there would be no complaints of loose hairs coming
out and spoiling the work. It is a common practice to leave the brushes
in a paint-pot, in which the paint is covered with water to keep it from
drying. The brushes are certainly kept soft and pliant in this way; but
at the same time the glue is softened, and the bristles come out as soon
as the brush is used. After use, brushes should be cleaned, and placed
in linseed-oil until again required, when they will be found in good
condition. Treated in this way, they will wear so much better that the
little additional trouble entailed is amply repaid. When brushes will
not again be required for some time, the oil remaining in them should be
washed out by means of turpentine, after which they may be dried without
deterioration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span> On no account should oil be allowed to dry in a brush,
as it is most difficult to remove after oxidation has taken place. The
best means are steeping in benzoline for a few days, or in turpentine,
with occasional washing in soda-water and with soft-soap, avoiding too
violent rubbing.</p>

<p><i>Water-colours.</i>&mdash;The manufacture of water-colour paints is more simple
than that of oil paints, the pigments being first ground extremely fine
and then mixed with a solution of gum or glue. The paste produced in
this manner is allowed to dry, after having been stamped into the form
of cakes. As soon as the hardened mass is rubbed down with water, the
gum softens and dissolves, and if the proportion of water be not too
great, the pigment will remain suspended in the solution of gum, and can
be applied in the same manner as oil-paint. To facilitate the mixing
with water, glycerine is sometimes added to the cake of paint, which
then remains moist and soft.</p>

<p><i>Removing Odour.</i>&mdash;(1) Place a vessel of lighted charcoal in the room,
and throw on it 2 or 3 handfuls of juniper berries; shut the windows,
the chimney, and the door close; 24 hours afterwards the room may be
opened, when it will be found that the sickly, unwholesome smell will be
entirely gone. (2) Plunge a handful of hay into a pail of water, and let
it stand in the room newly painted.</p>

<p><i>Discoloration.</i>&mdash;Light-coloured paints, especially those having white
lead as a basis, rapidly discolour under different circumstances. Thus
white paint discolours when excluded from the light; stone colours lose
their tone when exposed to sulphuretted hydrogen, even when that is only
present in very small quantity in the air; greens fade or darken, and
vermilion loses its brilliancy rapidly in a smoky atmosphere like that
of London.</p>

<p>Ludersdorf thinks that the destructive change is principally due to a
property in linseed-oil which cannot be destroyed. The utility of drying
oils for mixing pigments depends entirely on the fact that they are
converted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span> absorption of oxygen into a kind of resin, which
retains the colouring pigment in its semblance; but during this
oxidation of the oil&mdash;the drying of the paint&mdash;a process is set up
which, especially in the absence of light and air, soon gives the
whitest paint a yellow tinge. Ludersdorf therefore proposes to employ an
already formed but colourless resin as the binding material of the
paint, and he selects two resins as being specially suitable&mdash;one,
sandarach, soluble in alcohol; the other, dammar, soluble in turpentine.
The sandarach must be carefully picked over, and 7 oz. is added to 2 oz.
Venice turpentine and 24 oz. alcohol of sp. gr. 0·833. The mixture is
put in a suitable vessel over a slow fire or spirit-lamp, and heated,
stirring diligently, until it is almost boiling. If the mixture be kept
at this temperature, with frequent stirring for an hour, the resin will
be dissolved, and the varnish is ready for use as soon as cool. The
Venice turpentine is necessary to prevent too rapid drying, and more
dilute alcohol cannot be employed, because sandarach does not dissolve
easily in weaker alcohol, and, furthermore, the alcohol, by evaporation,
would soon become so weak that the resin would be precipitated as a
powder.</p>

<p>When this is to be mixed with white lead, the latter must first be
finely ground in water, and dried again. It is then rubbed with a little
turpentine on a slab, no more turpentine being taken than is absolutely
necessary to enable it to be worked with the muller; 1 lb. of the white
lead is then mixed with exactly ½ lb. of varnish, and stirred up for
use. It must be applied rapidly, because it dries so quickly. If when
dry the colour is wanting in lustre, it indicates the use of too much
varnish. In such cases, the article painted should be rubbed, when
perfectly dry, with a woollen cloth to give it a gloss. The dammar
varnish is made by heating 8 oz. dammar in 16 oz. turpentine oil at 165°
to 190° F., stirring diligently, and keeping it at this temperature
until all is dissolved, which requires about an hour. The varnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span> is
then decanted from any impurities, and preserved for use. The second
coat of the pure varnish, to which half its weight of oil of turpentine
has been added, may be applied. It is still better to apply a coat of
sandarach varnish made with alcohol, because dammar varnish alone does
not possess the hardness of sandarach, and when the article covered with
it is handled much, does not last so long.</p>

<p><i>Composition.</i>&mdash;The composition of paints should be governed&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) By the nature of the material to be painted: thus the paints
respectively best adapted for wood and iron differ considerably.</p>

<p>(2) By the kind of surface to be covered: a porous surface requires more
oil than one that is impervious.</p>

<p>(3) By the nature and appearance of the work to be done: delicate tints
require colourless oil, a flatted surface must be painted without oil
(which gives gloss to a shining surface), paint for surfaces intended to
be varnished must contain a minimum of oil.</p>

<p>(4) By the climate and the degree of exposure to which the work will be
subjected: for outside work, boiled oil is used, because it weathers
better than raw oil; turps is avoided as much as possible, because it
evaporates and does not last; if, however, the work is to be exposed to
the sun, turps is necessary, to prevent the paint from blistering.</p>

<p>(5) The skill of the painter affects the composition: a good workman can
lay on even coats with a smaller quantity of oil and turps than one who
is unskilful; extra turps, especially, are often added to save labour.</p>

<p>(6) The quality of the materials makes an important difference in the
proportions used: thus more oil and turps will combine with pure than
with impure white lead; thick oil must be used in greater quantity than
thin when paint is purchased ready ground in oil, a soft paste will
require less turps and oil for thinning than a thick.</p>

<p>(7) The different coats of paint vary in their composition: the first
coat laid on to new work requires a good deal of oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span> to soak into the
material; on old work, the first coat requires turpentine to make it
adhere; the intermediate coats contain a proportion of turpentine to
make them work smoothly; and to the final coats the colouring materials
are added, the remainder of the ingredients being varied according as
the surface is to be glossy or flat.</p>

<p>The exact proportions of ingredients best to be used in mixing paints
vary according to their quality, the nature of the work required, the
climate, and other considerations. The composition of paint for
different coats also varies considerably. The proportions given in the
following table must only be taken as an approximate guide when the
materials are of good quality:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Area Covered.</i>&mdash;For every 100 sq. yd., besides the material enumerated
in the foregoing, 2½ lb. white lead and 5 lb. putty will be required for
stopping. The area which a given quantity of paint will cover depends
upon the nature of the surface to which it is applied, the proportion of
the ingredients, and the state of the weather. When the work is required
to dry quickly, more turpentine is added to all the coats. In repainting
old work, two coats are generally required, the old paint being
considered as priming. Sometimes another coat may be deemed necessary.
For outside old work exposed to the sun, both coats should contain 1
pint turpentine and 4 pints boiled oil, the remaining ingredients being
as stated in the foregoing table. The extra turpentine is used to
prevent blistering. In cold weather, more turpentine should be used to
make the paint flow freely.</p>

<p>According to another authority, it is found that in painting wood, one
coat takes 20 lb. lead and 4 gal. oil per 100 sq. yd.; the second coat,
40 lb. lead and 4 gal. oil; and the third the same as the second; say
100 lb. lead and 16 gal. oil per sq. yd. for the three coats. The number
of square yards covered by one gallon of priming colour is found to be
50; of white zinc, 50; of white lead paint, 44; of lead colour, 50; of
black paint, 50; of stone colour, 44; of yellow paint, 44; of blue
colour, 45; of green paint, 45.</p>

<p><i>Measuring.</i>&mdash;Surface painting is measured by the superficial yard,
girting every part of the work covered, always making allowance for the
deep cuttings in mouldings, carved work, railings, or other work that is
difficult to get at. Where work is very high, and scaffolding or ladders
have to be employed, allowances must be made. The following rules are
generally adopted in America in the measurement of work:&mdash;Surfaces under
6 in. in width or girt are called 6 in.; from 6 to 12 in., 12 in.; over
12 in., measured superficial. Openings are deducted, but all jambs,
reveals, or casings are measured girt. Sashes are measured solid if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
more than two lights. Doors, shutters and panelling are measured by the
girt, running the tape in all quirks, angles or corners. Sash doors
measure solid. Glazing, in both windows and doors, is always extra. The
tape should be run close in over the battens, on batten doors, and if
the stuff is beaded, add 1 in. in width for each bead. Venetian blinds
are measured double. Dentels, brackets, medallions, ornamented iron
work, balusters, lattice work, palings, or turned work, should all be
measured double. Changing colours on base boards, panels, cornices, or
other work, one-fourth extra measurement should be allowed for each
tint. Add 5 per cent. to regular price for knotting, puttying, cleaning,
and sand-papering. For work done above the ground floor, charge as
follows:&mdash;Add 5 per cent. for each story of 12 ft. or less, if interior
work; if exterior work, add 1 per cent. for each foot of height above
the first 12 ft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carriage and Car Painting.</span>&mdash;The following is the substance of an address
delivered by McKeon, secretary and treasurer of the Master Car-Painters’
Association of the United States:&mdash;A first-class railway coach costs,
when complete, about 1200<i>l.</i> To protect this work, the painter expends
60<i>l.</i> to 120<i>l.</i> The latter figure will make a first class job. The car
has been completed in the wood-shop, and is turned over to the painter,
who is responsible for the finish. He is expected to smooth over all
rough places or defects in the wood, which requires both patience and
skill to make the work look well. Twelve weeks should be the time
allowed to paint a car, and it cannot be done in any less time, to make
a good job that will be a credit to the painter and all other parties
interested in the construction and finish of the car. Too much painting
is done in a hurry: proper time is not given the work to dry or become
thoroughly hardened before it is run out of the shop, and consequently
it does not always give the satisfaction it should; nor can it be
expected that hurried work will be so lasting or durable as that which
has the necessary time given to finish it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Priming Paint.</i>&mdash;The priming coat of paint on a car is of as much
importance as any succeeding one, and perhaps more. Good work is ruined
in the priming by little or no attention being given by the painter to
the mixing and application of the first coat. The foundation is the
support, and on that rests success or failure. The priming should be
made of the proper material, mixed with care from good lead and good
oil, and not picked up from old paints which have been standing mixed,
and must necessarily be fat and gummy, for such are unfit for use on a
good job, and will have a decided tendency to spoil the whole work.
Special care should be exercised, both in mixing and applying the
priming, and it should be put on very light, so that it may penetrate
well into the wood. Too much oil is worse than not enough. Good ground
lead is by far the best material for the undercoats on a car. Two coats
should be given to the car before it is puttied, as it is best to fill
well with paint the nail-holes and plugs, as well as defects in the
wood, so that moisture may not secure a lodgment, which otherwise will
cause the putty to swell, although sometimes unseasoned lumber will
swell the putty; and as it shrinks, the nail remains stationary, and of
course the putty must give way.</p>

<p><i>Best Putty.</i>&mdash;In mixing putty, which may be a small matter with some,
take care to so prepare it that it will dry perfectly hard in 18 hours.
Use ground lead and japan, stiffening up with dry lead, and whatever
colouring you may require in it to match your priming coats.</p>

<p>The next coats, after the work is well puttied, should be made to dry
flat and hard. Two coats should be applied, and, for all ordinary jobs
or cheap work, sand-papering is all that is necessary for each coat; but
when a good surface is required, I would recommend one coat to be put on
heavy enough to fill the grain; and before being set, scrape with a
steel scraper. The plain surface is all that requires coating and
scraping with the heavy mixture. For this coat, which is called filling,
use one-half ground lead and any good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span> mineral which experience has
shown can be relied on. This scraping of the panel work will fill the
wood equal to two coats of rough stuff, and saves a great amount of
labour over the old process, when so much rubbing with lump pumice was
done. Sand-paper when the filling is thoroughly hard, and apply another
coat of paint of ordinary thickness, when, after another sand-papering,
you have a good surface for your colour.</p>

<p>Rough-coating on cars has gone almost out of use, and few shops are now
using it to any extent. My experience is that paint has less tendency to
crack where rough stuff is left off. I do not claim that the filling was
the principal cause of the cracking, if it was properly mixed; but I
believe the water used in rubbing down a car with the lump pumice
injures the paint, as it will penetrate in some places, particularly
around the moulding plugs.</p>

<p><i>Finishing Colour.</i>&mdash;The car being ready for the finishing colour, this
should be mixed with the same proportion of dryer as the previous coat,
or just sufficient to have it dry in about the same time. A great error
with many car painters is using a large portion of oil in the under
coats, and then but little, if any, in the finishing coats; this has a
decided tendency to crack, the under coats being more elastic. Always
aim to have colour dry in about the same time, after you have done your
priming; by this plan you secure what all painters should labour to
accomplish&mdash;namely, little liability to crack. Work will of course crack
sometimes after being out a few months, or when it has repeated coatings
of varnish; and using a quick rubbing varnish on work will cause it to
give way in fine checks quicker than anything else. Many of the
varnishes used are the cause of the paint cracking, and no painter has
been wholly exempt from this trouble.</p>

<p><i>Cause of Cracking.</i>&mdash;The most common cause of cracking is poor japan,
which is the worst enemy that the car-painter has to contend with. The
greater part of the japan is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span> elastic, and will dry with a tack, and
the japan gold size has generally the same fault, although the English
gold size is generally of good quality; but its high price is an
objection to its use. A little more care in the manufacture of japans
would give a better dryer, and few would object to the additional cost.
Japan frequently curdles in the paint; it will not mix with it, but
gathers in small gummy particles on the top. Work painted with such
material cannot do otherwise than crack and scale, and the remedy lies
only in getting a good pure article of turpentine japan.</p>

<p>In regard to using ground lead, car-painters differ, as some prefer to
grind their own in the shop. I use the manufactured lead, and my reasons
for doing so are that it is generally finer than any shop can grind it
with present facilities, and it has age after grinding, which improves
its quality. You can also get a purer lead and one with more body than
you can by grinding in the shop, which is a fact that I think most
painters must admit. I have tested it very fully, and am convinced on
this point.</p>

<p><i>Mixing the Paints.</i>&mdash;Permit me to make a few suggestions here in regard
to the mixing of paint, which may not fully agree with others’ views.
There is just as much paint that cracks by putting it on too flat as by
using too much oil. Some painters mix their finishing colour so that it
is impossible to get over a panel of ordinary size before it is set
under the brush, and consequently the colour will rough up. Colour
should be mixed up so that it will not flat down for some time after
leaving it, and then you have got some substance that will not absorb
the varnish as fast as it is applied to the surface. This quick drying
of colour is not always caused by want of oil in it, but because there
is too much japan, and a less quantity of the latter will do better
work, and make a smoother finish. Give your colour 48 hours to dry
between coats; always give that time, unless it is a hurried job, and
experience has fully demonstrated that it is poor economy to hurry work
out of the shop before it is properly finished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oils, Dryers, and Colours.</i>&mdash;In car-painting, both raw and boiled oils
are used, and good work may be done with either, but I recommend oil
that is but slightly boiled, in preference to either the raw or the
boiled. After it is boiled, if it is done in the shop, let it stand 24
hours to settle, then strain off carefully; this takes out all the
impurities and fatty matter from the oil, and it will dry much better,
nor will it have that tack after drying that you find with common boiled
oil. Use the proper quantity of dryer in mixing your paint, and a good
reliable job will be the result. In car-painting, never use prepared
colours which are ground in oil, as nine-tenths of such colours are
ground in very inferior oil, and they may have been put up for a great
length of time, in which case they become fatty, and will invariably
crack. These canned colours do not improve with age, as lead and varnish
do.</p>

<p>Finishing colours should all be ground in the shop, unless special
arrangements can be made with manufacturers to prepare them; and the
colour should be fresh, not over 6 or 8 days old after being mixed, and
open to the air. Enough may be prepared at a time to complete the
coating on a job; but when colour stands over a week it is not fit to
use on first-class work, as it becomes lifeless, and has lost that free
working which we find in freshly-mixed colours. Such colour may,
however, be used upon a cheap class of work, or on trucks, steps, &amp;c.,
so that nothing need be wasted in the shop.</p>

<p><i>Varnishing.</i>&mdash;Three coats of varnish over the colour are necessary on a
first-class coach. The first coat should be a hard drying varnish put on
the flat colour; the quick rubbing that some use I would not recommend,
but one that will dry in five days (in good drying weather) sufficiently
hard to rub, is the best for durability. After striping and ornamenting
the car, and when thoroughly washed, give a coat of medium dry varnish.
Let this stand 8 days; then rub lightly with curled hair or fine pumice,
and apply the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span> finishing coat, which is “wearing body;” this will dry
hard in about 10 days, after which the car may be run out of the shop.
It should then be washed with cold water and a soft brush, and is ready
for the road. In varnishing, many will apply the varnish as heavy as
they can possibly make it lie, when, as a consequence, it flows over and
runs or sags down in ridges, and of course does not harden properly;
this also leaves a substance for the weather to act on. It is better to
get just enough on at a coat to make a good even coating which will flow
out smooth, and this will dry hard, and will certainly wear better than
the coat that is piled on heavily.</p>

<p>Varnishing, we claim, can be over-done, despite some painters’ opinions
to the contrary. We have heard of those who put 2½ gal. on the body of a
50-foot car at one application, and we have also listened to the
declaration, made by a member of the craft, that he put 2 gal. on the
body of a locomotive tank. Such things are perhaps possible, and may
have been done; but if so, we know that the work never stood as well as
it would if done with one-half the quantity to a coat. In varnishing a
car, care should be taken to have the surface clean; water never injures
paint where it is used for washing; and a proper attention to
cleanliness in this respect, and in the care of brushes used for
varnishing, will ensure a good-looking job.</p>

<p>Perhaps your shop facilities for doing work are none of the best, but do
the best you can with what you have. Select if possible, a still, dry
day for varnishing, especially for the finishing coat. Keep your shop at
an even temperature; avoid cold draughts on the car from doors and
windows; wet the floor only just sufficient to lay the dust, for if too
wet, the dampness arising will have a tendency to destroy the lustre of
your varnish. Of course we cannot always do varnishing to our perfect
satisfaction, especially where there are 25 or 30 men at work in an open
shop, and 6 or 8 cars are being painted, when more or less dirt and dust
are sure to get on the work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>A suggestion might here be made to railroad managers, which is that no
paint-shop is complete where the entire process of painting and
finishing a car is to be done in one open shop. A paint-shop should be
made to shut off in sections by sliding doors, one part of the shop
being used exclusively for striping and varnishing. I know from
experience that nine-tenths of the railroad paint-shops are deficient in
this particular, and still we are expected to turn out a clean job, no
matter what difficulties we are compelled to labour under.</p>

<p><i>Importance of Washing Cars.</i>&mdash;In regard to the care of a car after it
has left the shop, more attention should be given to this than is done
on many roads. The car should not be allowed to run until it is past
remedy, and the dirt and smoke become imbedded in the varnish, actually
forming a part of the coating, so that when you undertake to clean the
car you must use soda or soap strong enough to cut the varnish before
you succeed in removing the dirt. Cars should be washed well with a
brush and water at the end of every trip. This only will obviate the
difficulty, and these repeated washings will harden the varnish as well
as increase its lustre. We know that, in washing a car, where soap is
required to remove the dirt and smoke, it is almost impossible to get
the smoke washed off clean; and if it is not quite impossible, the hot
sun and rain will act on the varnish and very soon destroy it.</p>

<p><i>Re-varnishing.</i>&mdash;Cars should be taken in and re-varnished at least once
in 12 months; and if done once in 8 months it is better for them, and
they will require only one coat; but where they run a year, they will
generally need two coats. Those varnished during the hot months will not
stand as well as if done at any other time. Painting done in extremely
cold weather, or in a cold shop, is more liable to crack than if done in
warm weather.</p>

<p><i>How to Dry Paint.</i>&mdash;Paint dried in the shop where there is a draught of
dry air passing through, will stand better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span> than that dried by
artificial heat; and you will find, by giving it your attention, that
work which has failed to stand, and which cracked or scaled, was
invariably painted in the winter season, or in cool, wet weather. I have
paid some attention to this matter, and know the result.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodwork Painting.</span>&mdash;One of the attendant drawbacks of houses that are
newly built, or have been hastily finished for letting, is the inferior
painting of the woodwork, and its speedy destruction. The wood is not
thoroughly dry, and the consequence is the preparatory coat does not
adhere; the pores being full of dampness, it is impossible for the oil
to sink into them, especially as oil and water are unmiscible. Another
equally injurious condition is the gum-resin which exudes from the knots
of new pine and other timber. Painted over before it has time to come to
the surface, the coat is destroyed by the action of the gum. Now, these
evils have to be endured so long as the wood has no time to get
seasoned. The painter follows the carpenter without any interval of
time, and before the action of the weather can bring out the moisture
and resinous substances. A coating of shellac is usually given to the
knots, though this is often so thin as to be worthless. Crude petroleum,
as a preservative coat, is found to be an admirable preparation for the
painting. The petroleum is thin, and penetrates the wood, filling up the
pores, and giving a good ground for the coats of paint.</p>

<p>According to one American authority, the preparation is of great value.
The priming coat should be thin and well rubbed in, and it is better to
use a darker colour than white lead as a base. White lead forms a dense
covering to the surface, though it has its disadvantages. When petroleum
has formed the first coat, two other coats will suffice, one being the
priming coat, and a third coat may be given after the work has stood for
a season. It is a very desirable plan to leave the painting, or rather
finishing coats, for a time, so that any imperfections in the wood or
work may be dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>covered; it also allows time for any change of colour
that may be made. After the priming coat, it is usual in good work to
stop all cracks, nail-holes, and other defects with putty; but in the
commoner class of paintings, the coats are laid on quickly, the
preceding coat has hardly time to dry before the next is put on, and all
the defects of wood, bad seasoning, exudation of gum, &amp;c., quickly begin
to show themselves through and disfigure the work.</p>

<p>A good paint ought to possess body, power of covering, and flow evenly
from the brush, and become hard. Though zinc white has less body than
white lead, it is more durable, and will stand sulphur acids without
blackening. Some colours stand better than others; the ochres, Indian
and Venetian reds, burnt and raw umber, are reliable, and may be used
without scruple. It is also worthy of notice that salt air acts
injuriously on white lead, and zinc white is therefore preferable in
situations exposed to the sea-air. (<i>English Mechanic.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iron Painting.</span>&mdash;The decay of iron becomes very marked in certain
situations, and weakens the metal in direct proportion to the depth to
which it has penetrated; and although where the metal is in quantity
this is not very appreciable, it really becomes so when the metal is
under ¾ inch in thickness. The natural surface of cast iron is very much
harder than the interior, occasioned no doubt by its becoming chilled,
or by its containing a large quantity of silica, and this affords an
excellent protection.</p>

<p>But should this surface be at all broken, rust immediately attacks the
metal and soon destroys it. It is very desirable that the casting be
protected, and a priming coat of oil or paint should be applied for this
purpose; the other coats, though requisite, can be given at leisure.</p>

<p>The following is a process to which all cast-iron water pipes should be
submitted. It was introduced by Dr. Smith, and is equally applicable to
any other casting that can be manipulated:&mdash;Each casting is thoroughly
dressed, and made clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span> and free from the earth and sand which cling to
the iron in the moulds, hard brushes being used in finishing the process
to remove the loose dust. Every casting must be likewise free from rust
when the paint is applied. If the casting cannot promptly be dipped
after being cleansed, the surface must be oiled with linseed oil to
preserve it until it is ready to be dipped. No casting is on any account
to be dipped after rust has set in. The coal-tar pitch used as a paint
in this process is made from coal-tar distilled until the naphtha is
entirely removed and the material is deodorised. In England it is
distilled until the pitch is about the consistence of wax. The mixture
of 5 or 6 per cent. of linseed oil is recommended by Dr. Smith. Pitch
which becomes hard and brittle when cold will not answer for this use.
Pitch of the proper quality having been obtained, it must be carefully
heated in a suitable vessel to a temperature of 300° F., and must be
maintained at not less than this temperature during the time of dipping.
The material will thicken, and deteriorate after a number of pieces have
been dipped; fresh pitch must, therefore, frequently be added, and
occasionally the vessel must be entirely emptied of its old contents and
refilled with fresh pitch. The refuse will be hard and brittle like
common pitch, and consequently worthless for the purpose. Every casting
must attain a temperature of 300° F., either by previous heating or
during the immersion before being removed from the vessel of hot pitch.
It may then be slowly removed, and laid upon skids to drip. In the case
of water pipes, all those of 20 inches diameter and upwards will have to
remain at least 30 minutes in the hot fluid to attain this temperature.
The coating when cold should be tough and tenacious, and not brittle nor
have the slightest tendency to scale off.</p>

<p>In considering the painting of wrought iron it must be noticed that when
iron is oxidised by heating in contact with the atmosphere, two or three
distinct layers of scale form on the surface, and, unlike the skin upon
cast iron, can be readily detached, as by bending or by hammering the
metal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span> The outer layer of this scale is more highly oxidised than the
inner, and is slightly redder in tinge from the presence of a variable
excess of ferric oxide over that contained in the inner layer. The oxide
occurring in the outer scale is fusible only at a high temperature, is
strongly magnetic, and slightly metallic in lustre; while the inner
layers are more porous, dull, and non-metallic in lustre, less brittle,
and also less powerfully magnetic. It will be seen that the iron has a
tendency to rust from the moment it leaves the hammer or rolls, and that
the scale above described must come away. One of the plans to preserve
the iron has been to coat it with paint when still hot at the mill; and
although this answers for a while, it is a very troublesome method,
which iron-masters cannot be persuaded to adopt, and the subsequent
cutting processes to which it is submitted leave many parts of the iron
bare. Besides, a good deal of the scale remains, and until this has
fallen off, or has been removed, any painting over it will be of little
value. The only effectual way of preparing wrought iron is to effect a
thorough and chemical cleansing of the surface of the metal upon which
the paint is to be applied, that is, it must be immersed for three or
four hours in water containing from 1 to 2 per cent. of sulphuric acid.
The metal is afterwards rinsed in cold water, and, if necessary, scoured
with sand, put again into the acid bath or pickle, and then well rinsed.</p>

<p>The real value of any paint depends upon the quality of the linseed oil,
the quality and character of the pigment, and the care bestowed on the
grinding and mixing, and as all this is entirely a matter of expense,
cheap paints are not to be relied upon. The superiority of most esteemed
paints is due to the above causes rather than to any unknown process or
material employed in the manufacture.</p>

<p>The following excellent article on the preservation of iron and steel
structural work appeared in the ‘Illustrated Carpenter and Builder.’ It
conveys the most recent American opinion.</p>

<p>One of the most important economic questions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span> present day is the
preservation of iron and steel structures. In America many millions of
dollars are annually spent in the erection and construction of these,
and the amount is increasing in rapid proportion. Bridges, buildings,
viaducts, ships, and machinery are now being made of these materials, to
almost the entire exclusion of others. From their very nature iron and
steel are peculiarly subject to decay from atmospheric and other
influences. The question of preserving them is not merely one of
finance, but, especially in the case of railroads, one affecting the
lives and property of a large portion of the community. What, then, is
the best method of preserving them?</p>

<p>The almost universal method is by means of paints, or the application of
substances to their surfaces which will resist or retard the influence
of air, water, and other destructive agencies. The requisites of a good
paint for this purpose are that it shall adhere firmly to the surface,
and not chip or peel off, thereby leaving portions of the surface
exposed. It must not corrode the iron, else the remedy may only
aggravate the disease. It must form a surface hard enough to resist
influences which would remove it by friction, yet elastic enough to
conform to the expansion and contraction of the metal by heat and cold.
It must be impervious to and unaffected, as far as possible, by
moisture, atmospheric and other influences to which the structure may be
exposed.</p>

<p>The paints that have been used for this purpose are principally asphalt
and coal-tar paints, consisting of mineral and artificial asphalt or
coal-tar, either applied alone or combined with each other, and, more or
less, with metallic bases, and iron oxide paints and lead oxide paints,
especially red lead, in all of which the pigment is held to the surface
of the iron or steel by combination with linseed oil. The choice of
paints must lie, so far as our present practical experience goes,
between these three classes, zinc oxide being found to be entirely
unsuitable on account of a pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>pensity to peel off. What, then, is found
to be the experience in actual practice with these? Asphalt and coal-tar
paints “run” when exposed to the sun and other sources of heat, which is
a serious matter with vertical surfaces; and after a time become
extremely brittle and scale off entirely, leaving the under surface
exposed, unless the paint is constantly renewed. In the meantime the
exposed iron and steel are being corroded by rust. Iron oxide paints,
including “metallic brown,” are paints made from iron ore, or by some
chemical process with an iron base. These are invariably iron in a
greater or less degree of oxidation, or in other words, rusted iron. Now
it is well known that one of the most active promoters of rust or decay
in iron is the rust itself. Under the combined influences of the
moisture and carbonic acid of the atmosphere, iron oxide or iron rust
becomes a carrier of oxygen from the air to the metal, rust begetting
rust. It is therefore evident that this material alone has no preserving
effect on iron; in fact, it promoted its decay.</p>

<p>How is it when combined with linseed oil in the form of paint? In the
economy of nature, iron oxide is a great disinfectant. When in contact
with organic matter and moisture, even at a low temperature, under
favourable conditions, it readily gives up oxygen, destroying more or
less the organic matter, and being itself reduced to a lower oxide. When
thus reduced, with equal readiness it absorbs oxygen from the
atmosphere, and again passes it on, thereby promoting and eventually
ensuring the destruction or transformation of the organic matter with
which it may be in contact, either in the soil or elsewhere. The same
process appears to take place when combined with linseed oil in the form
of paint and exposed to atmospheric influences, the oil being the
organic matter. If linseed oil in drying formed an air-and water-proof
film, it might be urged that the oxide of iron would be entirely
protected from the direct influences of oxygen of the air and moisture.
Such however is not the case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>The most eminent authorities have recently shown that the dried film of
linseed oil, unless united with a pigment that combines chemically and
forms a water-proof coating with it, actually absorbs water very much
like a sponge. Where water will go air will also go, and we thus have in
direct contact with the iron oxide of the paint, which does not combine
chemically with oil, those elements, air, moisture, and organic matter,
which cause the iron to become a carrier of oxygen and a destroyer of
what it is in contact with. It is well known that iron paint darkens
with age; this is caused largely by the iron oxide losing oxygen, which
is partly transferred to the oil, burning it up and destroying its
tenacity, as may be seen by examining iron structures painted for some
time with iron paint or metallic brown, the paint being found extremely
brittle and in feathery scales. This is not all the damage that is done.
The iron oxide in the paint becomes a carrier of oxygen to the very
metal it was designed to protect, and the process of corrosion is
commenced and carried on under the paint, which eventually peels or
scales off, the surface of the metal being found more or less oxidised
and corroded.</p>

<p>Asphalt and iron oxide being thus shown to be entirely incapable of
preserving the iron, it remains for us to consider the effect of red
lead. This pigment has the property of forming with linseed oil a hard
elastic coating, clinging with great tenacity to the metal. It has no
oxidising effect on iron, and does not act as a carrier of oxygen from
the atmosphere after the paint has set, neither does it render the oil
brittle nor promote rust. When red lead fails, it is principally by
gradual wear or friction from the outside. It does not scale or blister,
which both asphalt and iron oxide paints will do, thereby requiring a
thorough scraping and removal of old material before a new coat can be
applied. Any red lead pigment adhering to the metal forms a permanent
base for subsequent paintings, and is utilised in further preserving the
metal. The U.S. Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span> specifications for ironwork in the new
Library Building of Congress provide that “all the work not
Bower-Barffed must be given one coat of pure red lead paint&mdash;not
metallic paint of any kind, but pure red lead&mdash;before leaving the shop
and becoming rusted.”</p>

<p>The experiments of the U.S. Navy Department on the preservation and
fouling of plates covered with different pigments may be interesting. A
plate of iron covered with asphalt paint was immersed in sea-water for
eight months and six days at the U.S. Navy Yard, Portsmouth, N.H. At the
end of that period it was found to be covered with scum and mud, and
very badly rusted. A plate coated with iron paint, immersed at Key West,
Fla., was found to be covered with branch shell and coral, but little
paint remaining, and very badly pitted and rusted. A plate with two
coats of red lead, at the Norfolk Navy Yard, was found to have a few
barnacles attached, but to be in fair condition, with no rust whatever
on the iron after the paint was removed. It will be seen that not only
did the red lead protect the iron better than the other pigments
referred to, but that the plates were in far better condition as regards
barnacles and fouling. The superiority of red lead being thus
established, it is adopted for use on hulls of U.S. Government warships.</p>

<p>On the Dutch State railroads a series of experiments extending over a
period of three years were made with the above pigments on scrubbed
plates, as well as those which had been pickled in acid to remove the
scale. It was found that the red lead was superior in each case to the
others.</p>

<p>If red lead is thus proved to be the best pigment for preserving iron
and steel structures, what is the proper method for applying it? We have
seen above that the value of red lead depends upon its forming certain
combinations with the oil, and actually setting very much the same as
plaster of Paris or cement sets when mixed with water. To successfully
work with the latter substances, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span> is necessary to put them in shape
as quickly as possible after mixing with water before the setting takes
place. If the chemical action of setting has partly taken place, the
material may be moulded, but it is known that good results will not be
obtained. Red lead, like these substances, must be applied to the work
before it sets with the oil. It is on this point that failures in the
use of pigment have generally occurred, because if it be applied after
the combining or setting process has taken place, the hard, elastic,
clinging coating will not be formed on the iron surface.</p>

<p>The following is the practice of one of the largest shipbuilding
establishments in applying red lead to the hulls of vessels. The plates
are first pickled in a dilute solution of muriatic acid; then passed
between rapidly revolving wire brushes, which remove all scale and dirt,
leaving the iron with a bright, smooth surface; then thoroughly washed
with pure water, and rubbed entirely dry; and immediately coated with
red lead and pure raw linseed oil. The red lead is first thoroughly
mixed with just enough linseed oil to form a very thick, tough paste,
which will keep for several days without hardening. This paste, as
wanted for use, is thinned down to the proper consistency for spreading
with pure linseed oil, and applied at once, care being taken to leave
paint-pots empty at night. A gallon of paint thus prepared contains
about 5 lb. of oil and 18 lb. of red lead, and will cover on first coat
about 500 square feet. In this way the red lead and oil get their
initial set on the surface of the iron, and the closer the pigment is
brought to the iron the more durable will it be found. Some parties
prime iron with iron oxide paint or metallic brown before applying red
lead, which appears to be a mistake, as this paint readily scales from
iron, and, of course, carries the lead with it. Others coat the iron
with oil before applying the red lead. This, too, prevents the adhering
paint from coming in contact directly with the surface, and should be
avoided, provided the iron is properly prepared by thorough cleaning
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span> removal of any scale and moisture, which is a matter of the
greatest importance.</p>

<p>In priming wood surfaces which are absorbent of oil, the best practice
favours the putting on of a coat of pure oil, or oil thinned with
turpentine, which shall penetrate the surface, and form a binder for the
subsequent coats. With iron, the case is quite different, provided we
have a paint which, from its very nature, can attach itself firmly to
the surface, because it is out of the question for it to hold on to the
surface of iron by any process of absorption into the pores of the
metal, as linseed oil will not penetrate to any extent. Such a paint
should be put directly on the surface of the clean, dry metal, as is
done in the cases of Government vessels referred to, without the
intervention of a coat of oil or other substances.</p>

<p>The rusting of iron before the application of paint, which is sometimes
recommended, should by all means be avoided, as it not only prevents the
contact of the paint with the metal, but induces a chemical action which
may go on with its corroding work under the applied paint.</p>

<p>As to the relative cost of iron oxide paints and red lead, there is no
doubt that the first cost of painting structures with iron oxide is
somewhat less than with red lead. The best railroad authorities state,
however, that labour in painting structural work costs twice as much as
material. The true economy must therefore be sought in the durability of
the paint as well as the preservation of the structure from rust. Actual
experiments have shown that structures painted with iron paint had to be
repainted in the third or fourth year, those with red lead not until the
sixth year.</p>

<p>In the second painting with iron paint, the old material must be
entirely removed before a fresh coat can be properly applied, entailing
considerable increased cost, whereas with the red lead no such expense
is necessary, but, as before stated, a portion of the pigment remains on
the iron, continuing to protect the surface, and is the very best base
for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span> the new coat, besides contributing materially towards it, lessening
the expense of each repainting. It will therefore be easily seen that,
although in first cost red lead may be slightly dearer than the iron
paint, yet in the long run it will be greatly cheaper, besides giving
assurance, for the reasons above stated, that the structure is not
deteriorating from the effects of the atmosphere and paint.</p>

<p>Before closing, it might be well to allude to the effect of lampblack
when mixed in small quantities, say an ounce to the pound of red lead.
It changes the colour to a deep chocolate, a possible advantage in some
cases, and also prevents the red lead from taking its initial set with
linseed oil as quickly as when mixed with oil alone. Experiments
recently made showed that this compound would remain mixed in paste form
with linseed oil some thirty days without hardening. Thorough mixture is
of the greatest importance, and should be done in the dry state before
adding the oil. If rapid drying is desired, Japan dryer can be mixed
with the oil used in thinning the paste before application with the
brush.</p>

<p>Too much stress cannot be laid on the great importance of having the
metallic surface perfectly clean and as free as possible from scale and
rust before the application of the paint. Where pickling with acid is
impracticable, as is frequently the case in railroad and other
structural work, thorough brushing with wire brushes should be resorted
to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fresco Painting.</span>&mdash;The following observations are due to Prof. Barff, who
dealt with the subject in one of the Cantor Lectures given at the
Society of Arts.</p>

<p>The ground upon which fresco is painted is a lime ground; and in order
to have a permanent picture, it is clear we must have a firm and stable
ground. In order to prepare that ground, first of all the wall must be
absolutely dry; there must be no leakage of moisture from behind. Lime
which has been “run” (as it is technically called by builders) for a
year or a year and a half is best to be employed, for in pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>portion as
the lime has been carbonated (though it must not be so to too great an
extent) by the action of the carbonic acid of the air it makes a better
and a harder mortar. With this lime must be mixed sand, and a great deal
depends on the selection of the sand. It must be river sand, and it
should be of even grain; the sand should be mixed with water, and
allowed to pass along down a small stream, so that in the centre of the
stream you would have sand grains pretty nearly equal in size. This is a
point of considerable importance. The reason why new lime cannot and
ought not to be used is because it blisters; small blisters appear on
the surface, and that of course would be ruinous to a picture. A
well-plastered wall should not have a blister or crack in it, and this
is secured by having your lime run for some time, of good quality to
start with, and mixed with good sand. There is no chemical process that
takes place in fresco painting other than this, that silicates are
formed by the action of the lime upon the sand, and carbonates by the
action of the carbonic acid of the air upon the lime.</p>

<p>In painting a fresco picture, inasmuch as there is no retouching the
work when it is finished, the artist must make his drawing very
carefully. The cartoon is made upon ordinary paper, then it is fixed
against the wall where the picture is to be painted. The part where the
artist decides to begin his work is uncovered, that is to say, a portion
of the paper is turned down and cut away, but in such a manner that it
may be replaced. Then the plasterer puts fresh plaster, about an eighth
of an inch thick, upon the uncovered portion of the wall, and the
plasterer’s work is of the utmost importance in fresco painting. The
workman ought to practise it well before he attempts to prepare the
ground for a large picture, and it is of the greatest importance to
allow the man to practise for several weeks before he is allowed to
prepare any portion of the ground, even for decorative: painting. In
this way he becomes accustomed to the suction of the wall, and upon the
suction of the wall depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span> the soundness of the ground and the success
of fresco painting.</p>

<p>When the plaster is first put on, of course it is very soft; the piece
of cartoon is replaced upon it, and the lines of the picture are gone
over with a bone point, so that an indentation is made, and then the
artist begins his painting. At first he finds his colours work greasy;
you cannot get the tint to lie on, it works streaky; but you must not
mind that, you must paint on, but you must only paint on for a certain
time, for if you go on painting too long you will interfere with the
satisfactory suction of the ground, which is so necessary to produce a
good fresco painting. Of course, nothing but practice can tell any one
the period at which he ought to stop. After some practice, you know
perfectly well by the feel when you ought to stop. If you feel your
colour flowing from your brush too readily, you ought to stop at this
period. You must then leave your work for a time, and go back to it
again. And then you will find, as the plaster sucks in the colour which
you have first laid on, that there will be&mdash;it may be in the course of
half-an-hour, it may be an hour, that depends upon the temperature of
the atmosphere&mdash;a pleasant suction from your brush, the colour going
from it agreeably, and you will find that it will cover better. Now is
the time to paint rapidly, and complete the work you have in hand. When
the colour leaves your brush as though the wall was thirsty for
moisture, you should cease painting; every touch that is applied after
that will turn out grey when it dries, and the colour will not be fast
upon the wall.</p>

<p>You will see, then, how impossible it is, with such materials, to paint
in the same style in which you paint a picture in oil-colour. Fresco
painting involves the adoption of an entirely different style from oil
painting. The frescoes of the old masters are not highly wrought up,
highly-finished works. They depend for their effect upon the
juxtaposition of tints, the shadows being intensified by lines and
cross-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>hatching. If you look at those reproductions of some of the most
valuable fresco paintings of the old masters, you will see the method
adopted by them depended upon the juxtaposition of tints, not upon
covering over, and over, and over again. That juxtaposition of tints
produces roundness, transparency, and has a very pleasing effect upon
the eye. If two tints are put against one another, they do not appear to
us as if they were single, but each adds something to the effect of the
other, and together they produce a pleasurable and agreeable effect, if
they have been properly selected. We all know how tempting it is to go
back to a piece of painting and do something to it that ought to have
been done before. We think that a touch will improve it, and we go and
make it: but in fresco painting the temptation must be resisted, for it
will be absolutely fatal to the permanency of the work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
